This is a comprehensive list of items that must be completed before November 4th in order to submit to PAX.
Some of these items will be scaled in order to meet the deadline. The goal is to have something "finished" and
completely debugged before November 4th. After that, I will return to each element and completely finish it for the
release of the actual demo.
