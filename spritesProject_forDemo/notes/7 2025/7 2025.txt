Today, I got the dialogue completely debugged and added voices and everything. 

I won't need to revisit dialogue until it comes time to perfect all of the encoded features.
That will probably happen once I near the end of cutscenes.

From this point, it would probably be best to head right into cutscenes. That way, I can
finish the gamestart flow, and get the tasks finalized (cutscenes will force me to finish
adding all NPCs into the demo)
