Today, I got the dialogue completely debugged and added voices and everything. 

I won't need to revisit dialogue until it comes time to perfect all of the encoded features.
That will probably happen once I near the end of cutscenes.

From this point, it would probably be best to head right into cutscenes. That way, I can
finish the gamestart flow, and get the tasks finalized (cutscenes will force me to finish
adding all NPCs into the demo)

CUTSCENES:

	-fix dialogue encoding system via note on scr_dialogue
	-test new dialogue encoding system
	-create and call new step event function for cutscene object
	-write create and step event functions for cutscene object
	-step event should check if the current step is complete (dialogue, movement, etc), then start the next one
	-each step will be a row on an excel spreadsheet. Each row will contain: speaker (index on character list), step content (always in form of dialogue, even if it's just one encoded step),

	-continue chipping away at the above list. Start by making a final decision about how to write action IDs (use macros that bind to strings e.g. INPUT_PLAYER_NAME = "INPUT PLAYER NAME" or use enumerated IDs)

7/8/2025

	-start filling out the switch statement in the "perform action" function on scr_dialogue
	-determine the best way to indicate and process character paths and emotes (probably best to keep the grid)
	-finish the case statements one-by-one, testing each one completely before moving on
	-once you hit the cutscene related actions, start building/testing the first cutscene
