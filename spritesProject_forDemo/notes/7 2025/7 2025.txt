Today, I got the dialogue completely debugged and added voices and everything. 

I won't need to revisit dialogue until it comes time to perfect all of the encoded features.
That will probably happen once I near the end of cutscenes.

From this point, it would probably be best to head right into cutscenes. That way, I can
finish the gamestart flow, and get the tasks finalized (cutscenes will force me to finish
adding all NPCs into the demo)

CUTSCENES:

	-fix dialogue encoding system via note on scr_dialogue
	-test new dialogue encoding system
	-create and call new step event function for cutscene object
	-write create and step event functions for cutscene object
	-step event should check if the current step is complete (dialogue, movement, etc), then start the next one
	-each step will be a row on an excel spreadsheet. Each row will contain: speaker (index on character list), step content (always in form of dialogue, even if it's just one encoded step),

	-continue chipping away at the above list. Start by making a final decision about how to write action IDs (use macros that bind to strings e.g. INPUT_PLAYER_NAME = "INPUT PLAYER NAME" or use enumerated IDs)

7/8/2025

	-start filling out the switch statement in the "perform action" function on scr_dialogue
	-determine the best way to indicate and process character paths and emotes (probably best to keep the grid)
	-finish the case statements one-by-one, testing each one completely before moving on
	-once you hit the cutscene related actions, start building/testing the first cutscene
	
7/11/2025

	-labeled all the arguments for each item in the new dialogue encoding key
	-need to go through mercurio's dialogue sheet and replace all old encoding symbols with new ones
	-after doing so, write out the logic for each of those types of dialogue actions, then test
	
7/12/2025

	-replaced all of mercurio's *SAD* etc calls with new *<`<>`<>>* ones
	-finished the DISPLAY EMOTIONS section of the swtich statement in the new action process function
	-realized that I'll need to follow the DISPLAY EMOTIONS method for all of these, since the text is processed in the create event, not while being displayed (need to indicate when to do it then wait)
	-continue writing the cases for the switch statement in the action process function
	-once you're finished with the action process function, replace all other action checks in the code with the new single asterisks check
	-once the action process function and dialogue build function are both complete, test each type of action and debug until finished
