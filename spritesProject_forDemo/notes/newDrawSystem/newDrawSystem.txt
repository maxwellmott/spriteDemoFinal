So after checking out different ways of drawing shadows, I realized that I really need to switch over to using surfaces.

Here is an in-depth description of how the new system should work:

	at game start and during each transition, an object should be created (maybe called humanSpriteManager) that will check the 
	target location, get a list of every npc that might come into the room. There should be a single function to build human
	sprites (human_build_sprite()) that can be called for the player
