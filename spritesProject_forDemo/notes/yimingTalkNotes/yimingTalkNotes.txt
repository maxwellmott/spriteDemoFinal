list of effects
-list by priority (what do we have already,
					what NEEDS to be in the demo vs
					what would be nice to have)
-information about each effect and its context


-get a build ready for yiming so that he can see all the effects
	and spells for himself

-fix background effect
	-have sprites fade out
	-have a different "screen" effect paired with each effect and spell animation
	-sprites flash when getting hit or when taking damaged
