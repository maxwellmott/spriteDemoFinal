list of effects
-list by priority (what do we have already,
					what NEEDS to be in the demo vs
					what would be nice to have)
-information about each effect and its context


-get a build ready for yiming so that he can see all the effects
	and spells for himself

-fix background effect
	-have sprites fade out
	-have a different "screen" effect paired with each effect and spell animation
	-sprites flash when getting hit or when taking damaged
	
	
	


			WHATS LEFT 
			
	okay, here's a list of what I need to do before I can send
	a build to yiming:
	
		-	add spellbook builder and teambuilder to the overworld (just add hotkeys for them for now)
		-	add descriptions to spellbook builder
		-	add spellbook menu artwork to the spellbook builder
		-	add all spell animations and effect animations that he's completed thus far!
