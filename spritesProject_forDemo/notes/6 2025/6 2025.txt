	FIX DIALOGUE FUNCTION VIA NOTE
		-change "response function" parameter to "special dialogue selection function"
		-each npc uses the standard dialogue selection (each NPC needs to have keys with matching suffixes (e.g. "mercurioDayThreePreMatch, indigoDayThreePreMatch)
		-create a list of key suffixes as well as an enumerator matching the names to numbers so it's easy to check each NPC's responses by the same key data (only need to find the correct suffix based on time of day etc)
