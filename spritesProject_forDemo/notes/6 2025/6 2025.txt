	FIX DIALOGUE FUNCTION VIA NOTE
		-change "response function" parameter to "special dialogue selection function"
		-each npc uses the standard dialogue selection (each NPC needs to have keys with matching suffixes (e.g. "mercurioDayThreePreMatch, indigoDayThreePreMatch)
		-create a list of key suffixes as well as an enumerator matching the names to numbers so it's easy to check each NPC's responses by the same key data (only need to find the correct suffix based on time of day etc)

WHILE YOU'RE IN THE CAR:

	-FINISH ADDING SPARMATE TO THE GRID (MAKE SURE YOU CREATE A SPECIAL ANIMATIONS LIST FOR HIM)
	-PUT SPARMATE IN THE DOJO AND HAVE HIM IDLE. EVERY SO OFTEN, HAVE HIM DO HIS PUNCHING ANIMATION.
	-CHANGE SPARMATE'S NAME TO SPARTNER EVERYWHERE
	-ADD DIALOGUE FOR SPARTNER
	-DEBUG BOOKISH'S DIALOGUE
	-MAKE NEW TALK BUBBLES PER THE NEW LOGIC
	-WRITE NEW TALK BUBBLE SYSTEM
	
	today, I finished adding sparmate to the grid. Got everything to the point that sparmate is
	on screen, looking great!
	
	I still need to debug the sprites' dialogue, for some reason the text is getting corrupted.
	
	I made the new talk bubble artwork, just need to add them into the game
	




6/24/25

	Finished most of the todoMenu. I still need to finish debugging it by checking it then talking to Bookish.
	I'll have to debug the scroll functionality once there is enough tasks in the game to allow for it.
	
	After that, you need to debug sprite dialogue and fix the talkBubbles.
	
	Then it's time to get back to cutscenes, and turntaking algorithms!
	
	

6/26/25

	Got back on track with my todo list spreadsheets.
	
	I fixed the talk bubbles almost completely. I might want to move sx and sy to block the speaker less.
	
	I also still need to debug the sprites' dialogue line-by-line.
	
	There are still a few things to fix with the todoList as well, and for whatever reason,
	bookish' normal dialogue isn't loading after giving her quest dialogue to the player.
	

6/30/25

	I finished the todo list functionality. Now, a player can successfully complete a quest and the quest 
	will progress off of their todo list. Now I just need to add the completedTasks and failedTasks draw functionality
	to the todoMenu
	
	I'm really leaning toward removing the window for the player's face.
	
	There are still some issues with talk bubbles, I think you need to take a look
	at the dimensions for the draw_text_pixel_perfect call
