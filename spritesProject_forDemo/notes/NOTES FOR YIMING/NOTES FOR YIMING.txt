	Hey there friend--got some bugs fixed and figured I would add this note.
	
	If you want to add one for me as well in the Last Thoughts folder, that would be awesome! I'd rather
stay the sole author of the pre-existing notes so that they don't get hard to read.

	Can't wait to chat on Monday!

	Hey pal! 
	
	I added ruburs grapple and the updated animation for psychic impact!
	
	I haven't yet implemented the code to stop drawing sprites during certain spell animations, but
	will get to it before our meeting on Monday!
