The mouse object should be working for all controller types. I haven't tested this yet
because I'm waiting to get the transition logic working first so I can test that the
mouse is being created and destroyed properly for all rooms. After this is totally secure,
I will finish creating the button struct and the menu building functions. (menus will
be arrays of buttons, navigatable using the arrow keys/left stick or by clicking them with
the mouse/right stick)

I created rm_gameStart. This will be the initial room each time the game is run. Here is
where the game object will be initially created. Once this is done, it should transition
to each splash screen and then to the title screen.

There is a note about what should happen after that RE checking for and loading save files
but that won't be a concern until after buttons and are working. THIS MEANS THAT 
TRANSITIONS ARE THE NEXT THING TO TACKLE. GET THE TRANSTIION FUNCTIONS WORKING IN TANDEM
WITH THE TRANSITION MANAGER OBJECT SO THAT WE CAN GET THE GAME START ORGANICALLY FLOWING
TO THE MAIN MENU, WHERE THE MOUSE OBJECT WILL FIRST BE CREATED.



7/11/22:

UNIFIED ANIMATIONS ARE UP AND RUNNING. USE THE FUNCTIONS GAME_TIMER() AND SET_FRAME()
IN THE GAME CLASS. WHEN DRAWING ANY ANIMATED OBJECTS (ASIDE FROM PLAYERS AND NPCS) PUT THE VARIABLE
global.frame AS THE SUBIMG ARGUMENT.


7/14/22:

I COMPLETED THE TRANSITION LOGIC. AS IT STANDS, THERE ARE TWO FUNCTIONS FOR TRANSITIONS. 
ONE TAKES YOU FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER IN THE OVERWORLD. THE OTHER TAKES YOU FROM ONE 
ROOM TO ANOTHER. THERE IS ANOTHRE FUNCTION THAT IS USED TO UPDATE THE PLAYER'S X, Y, AND 
FACING VALUES WHEN NECESSARY. 


THE NEXT THING TO TACKLE IS BUTTONS! THE GAME START FLOW IS CURRENTLY RUNNING SMOOTHLY,
THE SPLASHSCREENS PLAY, THEN THE USER IS TRANSITIONED TO THE TITLE SCREEN. WHEN YOU WORK
ON THIS NEXT, START TACKLING BUTTONS AND MENUS! I'M PROUD OF YOU, MAX.

7/18/22

BUTTONS AND MENUS ARE UP AND RUNNING. THERE ARE A LOT OF COSMETIC BUGS TO SORT OUT, AND THE ONE FUNCTIONAL
BUG OF HANDLING INDEX WRAPPING ON MENUS.

NOW THAT THIS ALL WORKS, IT'S TIME TO START FIXING UP THE COSMETIC BUGS, AND DESIGNING THE FINAL VERSIONS
OF EVERY MENU IN THE GAME! THE SOUL STONE MENU IS ALMOST FINISHED AND LOOKING GREAT. I'M SO, SO PROUD OF YOU MAX.


7/27/22

WORKING ON THE SOUL STONE MENU. I THINK I'LL MAKE THE BUTTON CONSTRUCTORS MORE VERSATILE AND GET RID OF THE
MENU SYSTEM. THE ONLY THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FINISHED WITH THE SOUL STONE MENU ARE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE
MAIN MENU BUTTONS, BUILDING THE REST OF THE SUBMENUS, AND FIXING THE BUTTON LOGIC. (CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO WAY
TO ACTIVATE THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS) I'LL MOST LIKELY JUST ADD FUNCTIONALITY TO ANIMATE THE APPROPRIATE BUTTON 
AND INCREMENT/DECREMENT THE INDEX RESPECTIVELY.

LATER SIDE NOTE:
	I SET UP A WORKING FUNCTION FOR STARTING A NEW GAME. THIS FUNCTION PUTS A PLAYER IN THE ROOM. I'M TAKING THIS STEP
	NOW FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING THE MAIN MENU FROM AN OVERWORLD STANDPOINT. PLAYER MOVEMENT PAUSING AND ALL OF THAT.
	
	THERE IS A BUG OCCURRING PROBABLY BECAUSE I CHANGED SOMETHING ABOUT THE LIST ENCODING FUNCTIONS AFTER GETTING
	THE DRAW HUMAN FUNCTIONS TO WORK. IT COULD ALSO BE THAT I'M NOT PROPERLY CREATING THE APPEARANCE STRING. 
	
	THERE IS CURRENTLY A BREAKPOINT WHERE THE DRAW HUMAN FUNCTION IS CALLED, BUT THE ISSUE LIES IN THE GET COLOR FROM ID
	AND SHADER SET RECOLOR FUNCTIONS.
	
	GOOD LUCK! THIS WILL BE A VERY HELPFUL NEXT STEP. <3 <3
	
7/29/22

TRANSITIONING FROM THE TITLE SCREEN TO THE OVERWORLD IS MOSTLY WORKING SAVE FOR SOME VISUAL BUGS. THE OPEN SOULSTONE FUNCTION DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. 
IT SHOULD JUST TAKE SOME SIMPLE DEBUGGING TO GET IT WORKING. IT MIGHT ALSO BE TIME TO FIX UP THE VISUAL BUGS WITH THE TRANSITION MANAGER, SO THAT
IT DOESN'T END UP MUCKING THINGS UP ANYWHERE ELSE LATER ON.

7/29/22 SIDE NOTE:
	I FINISHED UP MOST OF THE SOUL STONE/MAIN MENU LOGIC. I'VE NOW REALIZED THAT I HAVE A DATA LEAK SOMEWHERE.
	I FOUND A FEW GOOD ARTICLES BY SEARCHING "DATA LEAKS GMS2" AND "OPTIMIZING GMS2". I LEFT THE TABS OPEN, BUT
	JUST IN CASE, I'LL COPY A COUPLE OF LINKS HERE.
	
	https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/detect-memory-leak-with-debugger-profiler.83632/
	
	https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/216754778-Optimizing-Your-Games
	
	

7/30/22

GOT TO WORK ON OPTIMIZATION. SO FAR, HERE ARE THE MAIN PROBLEMS:

	-THERE IS TOO MUCH HAPPENING IN THE DRAW EVENT. I NEED TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE DRAW EVENTS AND TRY TO LIMIT ANY MATH THAT'S HAPPENING THERE.
	-TOO MANY GLOBAL VARIABLES ARE BEING CALLED PER FUNCTION. IF THERE IS ANY WAY TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE GLOBALS, OR STORE THEM IN LOCALS BEFORE OPERATING ON THEM, DO SO.
	-SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING WITH THE TEXTURE GROUPS. I'M NOT SURE OF HOW BIG AN ISSUE THIS IS.
	

7/30/22 SIDE NOTE:

	I DID QUITE A BIT OF OPTIMIZATION TODAY. AS IT STANDS, THE PLAYER DRAW EVENT IS STILL PRETTY HEAVY. THE FINAL ISSUE IS THE SETTING OF THE FRAGMENT SHADER VALUES.
	THE NEXT STEP IS GOING TO BE ADDING A FEW LIFELESS NPCS. THIS IS JUST SO THAT I CAN SEE HOW THE HUMAN APPEARANCE FUNCTIONS WORK FOR THEM. THIS WILL ALSO GIVE ME
	A GOOD IDEA OF WHETHER THE WEIGHT OF THE DRAW_HUMAN FUNCTION IS LIVEABLE OR IF I'LL NEED TO REDO THE SHADERS.

8/2/22

	THE SHADERS WERE FAR TOO HEAVY. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY TO REWORK IT, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF PROGRESS, I'M GOING TO SCRAP IT FOR NOW
	AND PLAN TO MAKE LARGER GRIDS WITH MULTIPLE COLOR OPTIONS FOR EACH OUTFIT.
	
8/5/22

	WOW! I CAN'T BELIEVE I FORGOT I COULD CALL COLORS BY HEX ID. I WAS ABLE TO FULLY RELACE THE COLOR SYSTEM IN THE GAME. NOTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE DIFFERENTLY
	ON THE USER'S END. EACH HUMAN'S COLOR VALUES WILL BE SET USING THE COLORS ENUM FROM SCR_COLORS. THIS ALSO COMES AT A VERY LOW COST, PROCESSING POWER WISE.
	
	ONCE I ADD IN SOME MORE HUMANS, WE'LL SEE IF THIS IS REALLY FEASIBLE!
	
8/12/22

	STARTED WORKING ON THE TILE SYSTEM. THE FRAMEWORK IS LIKE THIS: THERE WILL BE AN LIST FOR EACH TILE LAYER FOR EACH LOCATION (SO, 3 ENCODED TILEMAP LISTS PER LOCATION).
	THESE LISTS WILL BE TYPED OUT (IN A RATHER BLOCKY FASHION) EACH OF THESE LISTS WILL BE ENCODED AND ATTACHED TO THE LOCATIONS MASTER GRID.
	
	THE OVERWORLD CREATE EVENT WILL CALL THE USER MADE FUNCTION, PLACE_ALL_TILES, AND PLACE ALL TILES FOR EACH TILE LAYER.
	
8/24/22

	THERE IS CURRENTLY SO MUCH TO FIGURE OUT REGARDING COLLISION. THE ISSUE PROBABLY LIES IN BOTH FUNCTIONS (TILE_MEETING() AND HUMAN_WALK()). JUST CHILL FOR NOW,
	YOU CAN KEEP PERFECTING THIS OVER TIME. MAYBE DO GIVE IT ONE MORE GOOD SESSION TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT IT'S OKAY TO MOVE ONTO DOORS AND SWIMMING
	IF THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE TO KNOCK OUT. IT JUST NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TIME FOR NPCS.

8/26/22
	
	COLLISION IS WORKING PERFECTLY. I'VE GOTTEN ALMOST EVERYTHING WRITTEN OUT FOR SWIMMING TO WORK AS WELL. THE LAST STEP IS TO MAKE THE CSV FILE FOR THE OVERWORLD
	ALERTS GRID. THEN, MAKE A FUNCTION TO CHECK THE TILE IN FRONT OF THE PLAYER. ONCE THIS IS FINISHED, JUST FINISH THE START_SWIMMING FUNCTION AND ADD THE FUNCTIONALITY
	TO THE PLAYER STEP EVENT TO ALLOW THEM TO BEGIN SWIMMING BY CLICKING A WHILE FACING A WATER TILE.
	
8/27/22

	2:14 PM
		GOT THE OVERWORLD ALERT SYSTEM WORKING. I ALSO GOT INTERACTION SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING. I'M GOING TO MAKE THE FONT FOR OVERWORLD INTERACTIONS, THEN I'LL GET THE
		ROLLING TEXT FUNCTIONALITY UP AND RUNNING. I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO HAVE THE TEXT DRAWN STARTING IN THE TOP LEFT OF THE TEXT BOX, SO THAT'S A MINOR CHANGE I'LL
		NEED TO MAKE ONCE I FINISH UP THE OVERWORLD FONT.
		
		AFTER I GET THE ROLLING TEXT WORKING, I'LL NEED TO MAKE A FUNCTION FOR CHECKING THE SCENERY ID OF THE STRUCT IN FRONT OF YOU. THEN I'LL NEED TO ADD THE FUNCTIONALITY
		TO CHECK IF THERE IS A DOOR OR A KEYPAD IN FRONT OF YOU.
		
		YOU'RE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS! GOOD LUCK, I LOVE YOU!!!
		
	11:58 PM
		GOT THE START_SWIMMING AND STOP_SWIMMING FUNCTIONS WORKING PERFECTLY, AS WELL AS THE OVERWORLD ALERT AND THE OVERWORLD_YESNOPROMPT. THE NEXT THING TO FOCUS 
		ON IS THE REST OF THE OVERWORLD INTERACTIONS. MAKE THE OVERWORLD FONT ANDTHE ARTWORK FOR THE KEYPAD TOMORROW. SWIMMING LOOKS GOOD ASIDE FROM A FEW SMALL THINGS.
		
		GOOD JOB! KEEP WORKING AND KEEP SAVING YOUR PROGRESS!
		
8/29/22

	DOORS ARE ALMOST WORKING. THE INTERACTION IS OCCURRING, BUT FOR SOME REASON, IT'S JUST TRIGGERING AN OVERWORLD TRANSITION, EVEN THOUGH THAT DOOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOCKED.
	I'M SURE SOME DEBUGGING TOMORROW WILL REVEAL THE PROBLEM AT HAND. GREAT WORK TODAY ON ALL OF THIS! NOW I'M GOING TO BACK IT UP TO GIT AND CHILL FOR THE NIGHT.
	
	I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, GREAT JOB ON EVERYTHING SO FAR.
	
9/1/22
	
	3:21 PM
		GOT DOORS WORKING PERFECTLY. THERE ARE A FEW BUGS THAT ARE VISIBLY OBVIOUS AT THIS POINT. THOSE CAN BE ADDRESSED AT A LATER TIME. FOR NOW, LET'S KEEP TRUDGING ON UNTIL
		ALL OF THE OVERWORLD FUNCTIONALITY IS COMPLETE. AS OF RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE ABLE TO USE THE KEYPAD TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND THEN USE THE DOOR TO TRAVEL TO A DIFFERENT AREA.
		EVERYTHING IS WORKING PROPERLY ASIDE FROM THE CHANGING OF THE SIZE OF THE ROOM. FOR WHATEVER REASON, THIS IS FAILING. THIS SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE A PRETTY EASY FIX, SO GOOD
		LUCK!!!
		
	4:00 PM 
		I GOT THE TRANSITION TO WORK PROPERLY. THE ONLY PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THERE IS SOME GLITCHY SHIT GOING ON WITH COLLISIONS IN THE NEW ROOM. I SUSPECT THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WATER
		TILESET. I'M GOING TO FIX THAT LATER ON TONIGHT.
		
	9:15 PM
		I GOT THE PROBLEM SOLVED. BASICALLY, THE TILE CHECKER WAS SELECTING ITS SPRITE DURING ITS CREATE PHASE AND IT WASN'T BEING DELETED DURING OVERWORLD TRANSITIONS. SO, THE OVERWORLD DELETES THOSE
		IN ITS CLEAN UP PHASE NOW. FOR SOME REASON, THE ENTIRE TILEMAP ISN'T BEING DRAWN. THAT'S ONE OF A FEW BUGS. I'M GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE BUG REPORT TOMORROW. I'LL ADD ANY MINOR
		BUGS THAT CROP UP ALONG THE WAY FROM NOW ON SO I DON'T LOSE TRACK OF EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. 
		
		NEXT UP: BASIC NPC LOGIC. (AND ROLLING TEXT).
		
9/2/22
	
	10:47 PM
		I GOT THE BUG REPORT MADE. THERE'S A LOT OF ART I STILL NEED TO MAKE, SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY MAKE A LIST OF THAT AS WELL. 
		I ADDED THE ART FOR SHREDATOR AND GEMBO AS WELL. THERE ARE 16 SPRITES NOW. I'M GOING TO START MAKING THE EXCEL FILE WITH THE DESCRIPTIONS
		AND NAMES OF EACH SPRITE AS A WAY OF TRACKING AND COUNTING THE SPRITES IN THE GAME.
		
		
10/11/22

	I GOT THE PIT TILEMAP BUILT AND ADDED THE MISSING DOORS, BUT THERE IS A STRANGE BUG OCCURRING UPON ENTERING THE PIT FROM PIT FOYER.
	
	I ADD THE LINE OF CODE if (tileID >= 0) { BEFORE THE tilemap_set_at_pixel FUNCTION IS CALLED WITHIN THE place_all_tiles FUNCTION. I ADDED THIS
	SO THAT YOU CAN AT LEAST ENTER THE ROOM AND SEE WHAT MIGHT BE GOING WRONG.
	
	GOOD LUCK!!

10/12/22

	I GOT THE PIT TILEMAP FULLY ADDED AND GOT THE DOORS MOSTLY FIGURED OUT. I HAD A BUG WITH THE TILE COLLISION WHERE IT WASN'T PIXEL PERFECT IN THE
	NEW ROOMS, BUT IT WAS THAT I HADN'T ADJUSTED THE COLLISION MASK SETTINGS IN THE IMAGE EDITOR. 
	
	YOU'RE DOING GREAT! KEEP CHUGGING ALONG!!!
	
	
	
10/27/22

	I GOT THE SENDPORT ADDED AND GOT THE FIRST NPC ADDED TO THE NPC GRID. EVERYTHING IS READY TO SET UP THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR
	THE SENDPORT AND NPC OBJECTS!! TIME TO GET THE SCHEDULE BUILT. HERE IS THE LAYOUT FOR THE SCHEDULE:
	
				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
y = location	|
				|
				|
				|
				|_______________________________
						x = time of day

each spot on the table will be a list of which NPCs are meant to be in that location at that time. If they are supposed to be there
and they are not already, the sendport will instantiate them near itself. If they are not meant to be in that location any longer and
they still are, then they will teleport away.

there will be another grid with the following structure:

				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
				|
y = npc ID		|
				|
				|
				|
				|_______________________________
						x = time of day

where each spot on the grid will be the ID of a function containing instructions for the given npc for the given time of day.




10/28/22

	I WASN'T ABLE TO QUITE GET STARTED ON THE SCHEDULE, CALENDAR, AND WORLDCLOCK. I GOT THE SENDPORT SCRIPT MOSTLY FINISHED, I'LL
	JUST NEED TO COMPLETE THE spawn_npc FUNCTION, ONCE I HAVE THE SENDPORT IN THE ROOM PROPERLY. I'LL ALSO NEED TO WORK OUT
	THE TRANSPORT BUBBLE FUNCTIONALITY.
	
	BASICALLY, WHEN AN NPC OR THE PLAYER TRANSPORTS, A BUBBLE WILL APPEAR OVER THEM. ONCE THE FRAME COMES WHEREIN THE BUBBLE IS 
	FULLY PRESENT, THEN THE HUMAN'S SILHOUETTE SHOULD BE DRAWN IN WHITE OVER THE BUBBLE. ONCE THE FINAL FRAME WHEREIN THE BUBBLE
	IS PRESENT OCCURS, IT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DESTROYED THE NPC (IN THE PLAYER'S CASE, IT SHOULD MAKE THEM INVISIBLE UNTIL THE
	TRANSITION MANAGER IS PRESENT) AND IT SHOULD STOP DRAWING THE SILHOUETTE.
	

10/29/22

	I GOT A LOT DONE TODAY WITH THE SCHEDULE AND THE SENDPORTS. THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS GET THE TRANSITION BUBBLE WORKING AND
	WRITE THE spawn_npc FUNCTION.
	
	GOOD JOB TODAY! AND GOOD LUCK <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
	
	BACK TO WORK, I'LL LEAVE A SECOND NOTE BELOW WHEN IM FINISHED. THERE HASN'T BEEN A PUSH FOR TODAY YET. I WILL DO ONE AT THE
	END OF THE NIGHT.
	
	OKAY, SO I'M ALMOST COMPLETELY FINISHED WITH THE SENDPORTS AND NPCS. I JUST NEED TO FINISH THE SAFE_SPAWN_COORDINATES FUNCTION.
	GOOD LUCK! SLEEP WELL!!!
	

10/31/22

	I GOT ALMOST EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT FOR THE NPCs AND SENDPORTS, AND THEN I ENCOUNTERED THE WEIRDEST BUG I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.
	BASICALLY, IF THE REPEAT LOOPS BEING USED TO POPULATE THE SCHEDULE ARE CODED PROPERLY, THEN THE GAME DROPS TO 5 FPS AND THERE ARE
	NO ACTIVE INSTANCES. I HONESTLY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE, BUT I KNOW THAT THE GRID IS BEING FILLED CORRECTLY, AND THAT
	ALL OF THE SENDPORTS CREATE EVENT LOGIC IS BEING PROCESSED PROPERLY BEFORE THE CRASH OCCURS.
	
	LET IT BE NOTED THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY A CRASH, BUT JUST A MASSIVE PERFORMANCE DROP. I HAVENT CHECKED THE ACTUAL SPECS OF MY
	COMPUTER WHILE I'M DEBUGGING, SO MAYBE THATS A PLACE TO START WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THIS.
	
	GOOD LUCK!! I LOVE YOU AND YOURE DOING GREAT!!
	
	
	OKAY, SO I LOGGED BACK ON TO TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT THE BUG, AND I MANAGED TO LOCATE IT EXACTLY. BASICALLY, I'LL HAVE TO FIND
	A MORE LIGHTWEIGHT MEANS OF CHECKING FOR A SAFE SPAWN LOCATION.
	
	I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET MORE CLOTHING AND HAIRSTYLES IN THE GAME, AND THEN ADD THEM TO A GRID WITH THEIR NAMES TO
	MAKE THE CHARACTER CREATOR MORE CUTE AND USER FRIENDLY.
	
	
11/3/22

	OKAY, THE SCHEDULE MANAGER AND SENDPORT SYSTEM IS ALMOST COMPLETELY WORKING IN THE NEW ARCHITECTURE DESCRIBED IN ACITVE NOTES.
	
	THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS FIND THE OPTIMAL WAY OF POPULATING ALL OF THE TRAVEL METHOD LISTS. THEN, I CAN START DEBUGGING THE
	DOOR AND SENDPORT ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE METHODS.
	
	
11/4/22

	I GOT THE SENDPORT SYSTEM WORKING, I JUST WASN'T DECODING THE TRAVEL METHOD LIST, SO THE SCHEDULE
	MANAGER WASN'T SURE HOW TO GET ARRIVAL METHODS.
	
	I FIXED A FEW MORE BUGS, LIKE THE INVISIBLE DOOR FROM THE PIT FOYER TO PLACID VALLEY, AND THE
	INVISBLE KEYPAD BUTTONS.
	
	I ALSO LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR BEHAVIOR FUNCTIONS AND CHARACTER STATES TO BE ADDED. I JUST NEED
	TO MAKE ARTWORK OF THE HUMAN STRETCHING, SLEEPING, EATING, DRINKING, AND PLAYING wavephone.
	
	I ALSO HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE NPC TRAVELLING WILL WORK, SO I NEED TO GET A 
	FEW MORE OVERWORLD LOCATIONS BUILT OUT SO I CAN GET TESTING.
	
	WOOHOO! GOOD JOB AND GOOD LUCK <3 <3 <3

<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/7/22

	I GOT THE VERDMAN FARMS LOCATION MOSTLY ADDED. THERE ARE WORKING DOORS, AND ALL, THERE'S JUST A
	FEW INCORRECT TILES THAT I'LL HAVE TO CORRECT LATER.
	
	I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT NPC FUNCTIONS, AND REALIZED THAT I SHOULD SIMPLY CREATE A SINGLE
	FUNCTION TO MAKE THE NPC WALK IF THEY AREN'T IN THE CORRECT X AND Y POSITION.
	
	THEN, I CAN JUST CREATE SETS OF COORDINATES THAT DESCRIBE PATHS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/8/22

	Okay, I got most of the functionality sorted out for the npc behavior. Just check the activeNotes
	doc for more details. As it stands, there is an empty function being called by the npc object which
	is named npc_get_path. This function should get the next path off of the grid of paths (or whatever those
	end up being stored in)
	
	I LEFT THE CODE THIS WAY SO THAT YOU CAN CREATE A SINGLE PATH, STORE IT AS THE PATHLIST IN THE NPC CREATE
	EVENT AND TEST THAT FUNCTIONALITY BEFORE MOVING ON. 
	
	SO NEXT TIME YOU OPEN THIS, START BY COMPLETING A PATH FOR THORNTON TO TEST OUT IN PLACID VALLEY. THEN
	CHECK THE ACTIVE NOTES DOC FOR A LIST OF UNSOLVED ISSUES.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/9/22

	I GOT THE NPC MOVEMENT WORKING. NOW I JUST NEED TO FINISH THE REST OF THE ANIMATIONS FOR DIFFERENT STATES
	AND THEN TEST THAT THE PAUSING AND STATE CHANGING WORKS.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/10/22

	As you can see from the note above, I got NPC movement working yesterday, and now, I'm going to just make
	the fucking title screen look nice finally

<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
	
11/11/22

	I FIGURED OUT HOW TO HAVE THE ROUTINES ORGANIZED. THERE WILL BE A LIST FOR EACH NPC, FOR EACH ROUTINE, THAT STORES A
	LOCATION/TRAVELMETHOD/PATH FOR EACH TIMEBLOCK.
	
	THERE WILL BE FUNCTIONS THAT DECODE THE APPROPRIATE LIST USING A SWITCH STATEMENT. THE CORRECT VALUES WILL THEN
	BE STORED ON THE SCHEDULE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY USING THE ROUTINES DECIDED BY FLIPPING A COIN FOR EACH NPC.
	
	RIGHT NOW, THORNTON HAS ALL OF HIS LISTS BUILT. THE FUNCTIONS TO GET THE VALUES MUST STILL BE COMPLETED, AS WELL AS
	THE FUNCTIONS TO BUILD THE SCHEDULE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH DAY.
	
	JUST TEST TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS WITH THORNTON THIS WAY, THEN TRY IT OUT WITH STATE CHANGES, THEN TRY GOING THROUGH
	AN ENTIRE DAY. 
	
	ONCE THAT'S BEEN TESTED, START ADDING MORE LOCATIONS!!
	
	GOOD LUCK, I LOVE YOU <3

<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/12/22

	I DID SOME WORK ASIDE FROM THE PATH SYSTEM TODAY. I GOT THE TITLE SCREEN WORKING PROPERLY AND STARTED
	FIXING SOME MINOR BUGS, INCLUDING THE DOOR FROM THE PIT TO PIT FOYER.
	
	I WANT TO FIX THE DUPLICATE MESSAGE BUG THAT OCCURS AFTER YOU OPEN THE DOOR, BUT I HAVEN'T QUITE BEEN ABLE
	TO LOCATE IT YET. SINCE IT ONLY OCCURS WITH THE UNLOCKING OF DOORS, AND NEVER AFTER ANY OTHER YES/NO PROMPTS,
	I IMAGINE THAT THE BUG IS WITHIN THE UNLOCK_DOOR FUNCTION.
	
	AFTER THAT--BACK TO NPCS!!! 

<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

11/27/22

	I'VE BEEN CHUGGING AWAY AT ALL OF THE TILEMAPS AND SCENERY SHEETS, AND I'M ALMOST FINISHED! THERE IS
	A LIST OF ALL OF THE ARTWORK STILL NECESSARY.
	
	ALL I DID TODAY WAS GET THE COLLIDABLE OBJECTS WORKING. I RESTRUCTURED THE SCENERY SO THAT THERE IS AN OBJECT
	FOR EACH SCENERY TYPE, INSTEAD OF USING STRUCTS. EACH OF THESE IS A CHILD OF AN OBJECT CALLED collidableObject WHICH
	WILL SET THE BOUNDING BOX FOR EVERY SCENERY ITEM ACCORDINGLY.
	
	CURRENTLY, IT'S USING THE WHOLE SPRITE AND SETTING THE BBOX AS A SECTION OF THE SPRITESHEET FOR
	THAT SCENERY TYPE. I'M WORRIED THAT THIS MIGHT NOT BE OPTIMAL, SO IF YOU SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT
	DROPS IN PERFORMANCE, TRY CREATING A COLLIDABLE RECTANGLE WITH VARIABLE SIZE AND USING THE
	BBOX WIDTH AND HEIGHT VARIABLES TO CREATE ONE FOR EACH SCENERY ITEM.
	
	GOOD LUCK!!!! BACK TO ART FOR A WHILE.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
	
2/22/23

	OOF, IT'S BEEN A WHILE. LIFE HAS BEEN CRAZY AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME GETTING ALL OF THE EXTERIOR LOCATIONS READY. TODAY I INPUT
	THE TILEMAP DATA FOR THE GROUND TILE LAYER FOR THE BOULDER BEACH AREA. HOPEFULLY I'LL GET QUICKER AT THIS, OR MAYBE I'LL COME UP
	WITH A WAY OF DOING IT PROGRAMATICALLY SOMEHOW. UNTIL THEN, GOOD LUCK GETTING THIS SHIT DONE QUICKLY!! 
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

2/24/23

	I ADDED ALL OF THE TILEMAP DATA FOR BOULDER BEACH AND RUNTIME IS FINE. I GOT THE SCENERY WORKING FOR THE MOST PART. EVERYTHING IS
	LOADING CORRECTLY WITH SOME CLUSTERS IN BOULDER BEACH, BUT COLLISION ISN'T WORKING YET. I'LL NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE
	WRITTEN SO FAR AND WHAT MIGHT STILL BE MISSING TONIGHT WHEN I GET HOME.
	
	GREAT JOB TODAY! EVERYTHING SEEMS GOOD TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK!
	
	
	ADDITIONAL NOTE:
	
		I ENDED UP GETTING OBJECT BASED COLLISION WORKING PERFECTLY WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE! THEN I WENT ON AND GOT THE CAMERA FIXED
		SO THAT IT DOESN'T MOVE PAST THE EDGES OF THE ROOM.
		
		I WROTE A FUNCTION TO SET DEPTH FOR SCENERY (THE REGULAR FUNCTION WASN'T WORKING SINCE THE y FOR EACH SCENERY OBJECT IS AT THE TOP 
		OF THE SPRITE BEING DRAWN. NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE CHARACTER CAN GO BEHIND THE CLUSTERS IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS AND SOME OF THE
		CLUSTERS DON'T HAVE THE LOWERMOST OBJECT AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SPRITE.
		
		SO, I NEED TO REARRANGE THE OBJECTS FOR THE CLUSTERS NOW THAT I KNOW THE SYSTEM WORKS AND I HAVE A MEANS OF TESTING DIFFERENT PLANS.
		RIGHT NOW, I'M THINKING THAT TRIANGLES WOULD BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION, SINCE IT WOULD ALLOW THE PLAYER TO GO BELOW THE BOTTOM ROW, BUT OTHERWISE,
		THEY ARE ALWAYS BEHIND THE CLUSTER.
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

2/25/23

	THIS MORNING I GOT SOME RANDOM STUFF DONE. I CHANGED ALL OF THE CLUSTERS TO TRIANGLES, BUT NOW I'M HAVING SOME CONFUSING PROBLEMS
	REGARDING DEPTH. I'M THINKING THAT AFTER I TAKE A BREAK FROM WORKING FOR A WHILE, I'LL COME BACK WITH A CLEAR HEAD AND IT WILL BE
	OBVIOUS.
	
	BASICALLY, I CAN'T GET THE DEPTH FUNCTION TO WORK THE WAY THAT I EXPECT IT TO, EVEN THOUGH DEBUGGING SHOWS THAT THE MATH IS CORRECT.
	THE BOULDERS JUST REFUSE TO EVER BE BEHIND THE PLAYER.
	
	GOOD LUCK!!


	ADDITIONAL NOTE:
		
		I CAME BACK TO THIS ISSUE LATER IN THE EVENING AND IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT THE BUG WAS OCCURRING DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE
		PLAYER'S DEPTH WAS BEING SET SIMPLY USING THEIR Y VALUE, NOT USING THE Y VALUE OF BOTTOM OF THEIR FEET. SO I CREATED A 
		HUMAN_SET_DEPTH FUNCTION IN THE HUMANS SCRIPT. 
		
		I ALSO ADDED SOME BOULDERS AND CLUSTERS OF BOULDERS TO THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF BOULDER BEACH TO BLOCK THE WALLS THERE. EVEN
		WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF BOULDERS AND CLUSTERS, I'M NOT LOSING MUCH RUNSPEED. HOPEFULLY I CAN IMPLEMENT THIS SYSTEM 
		WITHOUT NEEDING TO MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
		
		GREAT JOB AND GOOD LUCK WITH HOMEWORK TOMORROW! <3<3<3
		
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

2/28/23

	TODAY I JUST WORKED ON ENTERING MORE TILEMAP DATA. I'M ONTO DRAGON'S JAWS, NOW. NOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBERS ON THE TILESETS, IT'S
	GOING MUCH FASTER THAN BEFORE. I ALSO DECIDED THAT I SHOULD GO AHEAD AND CHANGE THE PLAYERPOINTER TO AN OBJECT OF IT'S OWN.
	
	IT COULD WORK LIKE THIS:
	
		THE POINTER COULD BE THE SIZE OF THE PLAYER MASK. 
		BOOLEAN VARIABLES collidingWater, collidingTile, AND collidingObject WOULD BE SET TO TRUE IN A COLLISION EVENT WITH THE
		waterTileChecker, collidableTileChecker, AND sceneryCollidable OBJECTS. 
		
		THE X AND Y WOULD STILL BE SET THE SAME WAY, BY LIGHTLY ADAPTING THE human_set_pointer FUNCTION.
		
		GOOD LUCK! GOOD JOB! I LOVE YOU!!!
		
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/1/23

	TODAY I ADDED THE TILEMAPS FOR DRAGON'S JAWS. I ALSO FIXED UP SOME THINGS ON THE TILEMAP ARTWORK THAT I'VE BEEN USING AS A GUIDE.
	I'M THINKING OF GETTING ONLINE AGAIN LATER AND WORKING ON THE NEW POINTER SYSTEM.

	
	SO I DID END UP COMING BACK AND STARTING TO WORK ON THE NEW POINTER SYSTEM. IT ENDED UP TAKING THE FORM OF AN OBJECT AND SOME FUNCTIONS
	THAT GET CALLED WHEN CHECKING TO SPAWN, GET IN THE WATER, OR OUT OF THE WATER. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES AS IT IS, PRIMARILY, I NEED TO 
	GET THE TIMING CORRECT BETWEEN THE OBJECT AND THE FUNCTION. I'M TRYING TO USE A WHILE LOOP RIGHT NOW, BUT I CAN'T GET IT TO BREAK AT
	THE RIGHT TIME.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/2/23

	THIS MORNING I WOKE UP DETERMINED TO FIX THE CHECK_WATER_GET_OUT FUNCTION AND I DID! I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE WHILE LOOP WAS
	A TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING ON MY PART. THE PURPOSE OF THE WHILE LOOP WAS TO MAKE THE FUNCTION WAIT FOR THE SPAWN CHECKER OBJECT TO
	PROCESS IT'S CODE AND CHECK FOR COLLISIONS, BUT THE FACT THAT THE WHILE LOOP WAS BEING PROCESSED OVER AND OVER JUST MEANT THAT
	THE SPAWN CHECKER OBJECT COULDN'T PROCESS ANY OF IT'S CODE. I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT A BIT BETTER, WHICH IS GOOD!
	
	ANYWAY, IT TURNS OUT I'M A DUMMY, AND I SHOULD HAVE JUST READ UP ON THE COLLISION_RECTANGLE FUNCTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S
	WHAT'S BEING CALLED TO CHECK FOR GAMEMAKER'S COLLISION EVENT. SO NOW, THE FUNCTIONS JUST USE MULTIPLE COLLISION RECTANLGES, EACH
	THE SIZE OF THE HUMAN COLLISION MASK (AND IN THE POSITION OF THE DESIRED SPAWN) TO CHECK FOR EACH OF THE NECESSARY OBJECTS.
	
	SO ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER IN THE FUTURE SINCE THIS FUNCTION EXISTS! IT ALSO HELPS ME IMAGINE HOW 3D COLLISIONS WOULD
	WORK IN GAMEMAKER. I JUST WISH I COULD UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE DOING THIS CHECK SO OPTIMALLY WHEN IT WAS SO SLOW WHEN I WAS DOING
	THE MATH WITH MY OWN CODE. OH WELL! IT WAS PROBABLY THE WEIGHT OF THE FUNCTIONS I WAS USING TO DO THE MATH. THEY PROBABLY DO A 
	CHECK USING BUFFERS REPRESENTING THE IMAGE DATA INSTEAD OF DOING A CHECK FOR EACH PIXEL ON THE SCREEN.
	
	GOOD JOB! DO A PUSH AND KEEP WORKING HARD!! <3<3<3
	
	OKAY, I STILL DON'T FEEL LIKE DIVING BACK INTO ENTERING TILE DATA, SO I'M GOING TO WORK ON THE SIDEGATES. REMEMBER THAT THERE
	NEEDS TO BE A FUNCTION TO TRANSPORT THE PLAYER VIA SIDEGATE AND ALSO THE NPCS. ASKING IF THEIR MASK'S TOP IS BELOW ZERO 
	TO SEE IF THEY'VE LEFT THROUGH THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, AND SO ON, SHOULD BE FINE.
	
	OKAY, I GOT THE LOCATIONS SCRIPT COMPLETELY FINISHED, ASIDE FROM EDITS THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO EXISTING TILEMAPS.
	
	I'M GOING TO DO A PUSH, TAKE A BREAK, AND FINISH UP THOSE FUNCTIONS.
	
	THE PLAYER_GATE_CHECK FUNCTION WORKS PERFECTLY! THE NPC VERSION IS ALL SET UP, BUT I'LL NEED TO REFAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE 
	ARCHITECTURE OF THE SCHEDULE BEFORE I GET IT WORKING PERFECTLY.
	
	WHEN YOU RETURN, MAYBE LOOK AT THE CODE FOR HOW DOORS HANDLE NPC COLLISIONS! (UNLESS YOU DIDN'T RIGHT THAT YET)
	
	GOOD JOB! GOOD LUCK! GOOD NIGHT <3<3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/3/23

	I LOGGED ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE TONIGHT TO LOOK AT A FEW THINGS AND MENTALLY PREPARE FOR TOMORROW. TWO THINGS:
	
	1. I REFRESHED MY MEMORY ON HOW THE NPC SCHEDULE WORKS. BASICALLY, I NEED TO USE THE DEPARTING_NPCS LIST TO MAKE THE SENDPORT
	TELEPORT AWAY THOSE WHO ARE MEANT TO USE THAT MEANS OF TRAVEL. I'LL NEED TO USE THE FOUR NUMBERS FOLLOWING DOORS.HEIGHT TO SIGNIFY
	THAT AN NPC WILL BE TRAVELLING USING THE GATES. I'LL GET THAT SET UP AND THEN RESTRUCTURE THORNTON'S SCHEDULE TO TEST OUT DEPARTURES.
	ALL I NEED TO MAKE SURE OF IS THAT THERE AREN'T ANY PROBLEMS WHEN I ARBITRARILY SWITCH THEIR LOCATION ON THE SCHEDULE.
	
	2. I FOUND AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE/VIDEO ABOUT 2D DYNAMIC overworldDraw. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL AND GET DYNAMIC overworldDraw
	AND SHADOW CASTING WORKING. THEN, I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO MAKE A SINGLE LIGHT SOURCE THAT IS CREATED WHEN EACH LOCATION IS BUILT
	(SO LONG AS IT IS DAYTIME). THERE CAN BE A DATA STRUCTURE CONTAINING COORDINATES FOR EACH LOCATION FOR EACH TIME OF DAY, AND IT CAN
	CONSTANTLY MOVE TOWARD WHATEVER THE NEXT ENTRY ON THE LIST IS. THEN, DURING NIGHTTIME, I CAN MAKE LIGHTSOURCES AT ALL OF THE SCONCES
	AND WINDOWS THAT ARE MARKED AS 'ON', AND DRAW A FAINT BLUE LIGHT OVER EVERYTHING REPRESENTING MOON AND STAR LIGHT.
	
	GOOD LUCK! GOOD JOB! HAVE FUN TOMOORROW! <3<3<3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/4/23

	OKAY, I GOT SOME BUGS FIXED THIS MORNING. PRIMARILY, THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE TILE_MEETING FUNCTION WHERE IT WAS CREATING IMAGINARY
	TILES TO BUMP INTO WHEN THE X OR Y WAS OFF SCREEN. I HAD TO MAKE A COUPLE OF CHANGES AND THIS ALL RESULTED IN THE REALIZATION THAT
	I NEEDED TO HAVE A NEW WAY OF MANAGING COLLISION WITH THE SIDES OF THE SCREEN. 
	
	THE FINAL SOLUTION IS PRETTY UGLY... THE PLAYER BASICALLY BUMPS BACK ONTO THE SCREEN AFTER WALKING ENDLESSLY INTO THE INVISIBLE WALL.
	THIS ISN'T A HUGE DEAL TO ME RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE PLAN IS TO HAVE ALL OF THESE AREAS BLOCKED BY COLLIDABLE SCENERY ANYHOW, SO FOR A
	FAILSAFE, IT'S PROBABLY FINE IN THE LONG RUN (DEFINITELY FINE FOR NOW)
	
	NOW I'M GOING TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE overworldDraw SYSTEM, (WHOO BOY...!) SO I'M GOING TO DO A PUSH REALLY QUICK BEFORE I DIVE IN.
	
	GOOD JOB GOOD LUCK I LOVE YOU!!! <3
	
	OKAY, SO I FIGURED OUT HOW I'M GOING TO DO overworldDraw. 
	
	DURING DAYTIME, ALL COLLIDABLE/UPSTAIRS TILES AND OBJECTS WILL DRAW SHADOWS IN THE FASHION SHOWN BY FRIENDLY COSMONAUT, USING
	THE DRAW_SPRITE_POS FUNCTION. SOME OF THE DRAW_HUMAN_SHADOW FUNCTION IS ALREADY WRITTEN, BUT I NEED TO SET UP A NEW SYSTEM FOR
	DRAWING HUMAN SPRITES. 
	
	THE PLAN IS TO MAKE A LISTS FOR EACH LOCATION CONTAINING THE IDS OF EACH NPC THAT COULD EVER GO TO THAT LOCATION. THEN, DURING
	EACH OVERWORLD_TRANSITION, I'LL MAKE A SURFACE FOR EACH NPC ON THE NEW LOCATION'S LIST THAT CONTAINS ALL OF THEIR APPEARANCE
	LAYERS AND THEN SAVE THEM EACH AS SPRITES BELONGING TO THE OVERWORLD OBJECT. (MAYBE I'LL USE A DS_MAP TO ATTACH SPRITE IDS TO
	NPC IDS)
	
	THIS WILL BE GOOD IN A LOT OF WAYS. FIGURING IT OUT FOR THE PLAYER WILL BE SIMPLER, BUT I'LL HAVE TO RESET IT EVERY TIME THEY
	CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE.
	
	DURING NIGHTTIME (AND IN CAVES) THERE WILL BE A LAYER OF DARK BLUE DRAWN OVER EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT ALL LOOK DARKER, AND ALL OF
	LIGHTS CAN DRAW A YELLOW GLOW ABOVE THAT LAYER, TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S PIERCING THROUGH THE DARK. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS SHADOW
	CASTING WITH THE CURRENT PERSPECTIVE TRICKS I'M WORKING WITH.
	
	GOOD JOB GOOD LUCK!!!
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
	
3/5/23
	
	TODAY WAS THE DAY THAT I BEGAN WORKING ON THE NEW SYSTEM FOR STORING SPRITES IN THE MEMORY. THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OF BUGS,
	BUT I FINALLY GOT EVERYTHING WRITTEN TO THE POINT OF TESTING.
	
	FIRST BUG:
			I JUST FORGOT TO FIX THE NPC SCHEDULES SO THAT THEY ALL COME TO BOULDER BEACH
			
	SECOND BUG:
			FOR SOME REASON, THE PLAYER'S SPRITE IS NEVER CHANGING FROM -1, SO HE'S ALWAYS INVISIBLE.
			
			GOOD JOB! GOOD LUCK! I LOVE YOU!!!
			
			
	OKAY, I LOGGED ON FOR A FEW MINUTES AND GOT THE FIRST BUG SORTED OUT. BASICALLY, THE PLAYER WAS TRYING TO SET THEIR
	SPRITE BEFORE THE OVERWORLD WAS FINISHED SETTING UP AND THE PLAYER'S STATE WAS NEVER BEING PROPERLY SET.
	
	GOOD JOB! GOOD LUCK! I LOVE YOU!!!
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/7/23

	OKAY, TODAY WAS A LONG DAY WITH A LOT OF LITTLE BITS OF WORK. 
	
	THE PROJECT ISN'T IN AN OPERATIVE STATE RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO TAKE THE REST OF THE NIGHT OFF AND RELAX.
	
	THE overworldDraw SYSTEM IS ALMOST COMPLETELY UP AND RUNNING, THERE'S JUST A FEW BUGS TO GET FIGURED OUT!
	
	GOOD JOB, GOOD LUCK, I LOVE YOU!!!
	
	HEY! overworldDraw WORKS NOW! SO THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME. GREAT JOB MAN, YOU'RE DOING REALLY WELL!
	
	JUST KEEP CHUGGING ALONG! THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT TO DO BEFORE ALL OF THE TILES ARE ADDED, SO IT'S PROBABLY TIME
	TO GET BACK TO CASUALLY ENTERING TILE DATA AND FINISHING ARTWORK WHILE I GET SETTLE INTO SCHOOL AND WORK.
	
	WAY TO GO GETTING ALL OF THIS SET UP BEFORE LIFE TAKES BACK OVER :) THIS GAME IS LOOKING GREAT AND SHOULD BE FINISHED
	UP BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND I'M SO GLAD YOU'VE CONTINUED TO PUSH AND MAKE IT THIS FAR!
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/8/23

	OKAY! SO IT WAS ANOTHER LONG DAY, AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE TOOK A FEW STEPS BACK :(
	
	IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. BASICALLY, I'M USING THE OVERWORLDDRAW OBJECT TO DRAW EVERYTHING TO A SURFACE
	NOW AND THEN DRAWING THAT SURFACE IN THE GAME OBJECT'S POST-DRAW EVENT.
	
	I ALSO WROTE A FUNCTION TO HANDLE THE DEPTH OF OBJECTS MYSELF, SO I CAN USE THAT IF I NEED.
	
	BASICALLY, I HAVE ALL OF THE MAKINGS OF A NEW SYSTEM, BUT EVERYTHING ENDED UP BEING WONKY AT THE END!
	
	A BIT OF RESEARCH SHOULD HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE CAMERA IS WORKING, AND HOW SURFACES WORK.
	
	GOOD JOB TODAY THOUGH, YOU'RE TAKING BIG STEPS FORWARD IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND IT WILL BE REALLY GREAT IN THE LONG RUN!
	
	I LOVE YOU! GREAT JOB! GOOD LUCK!
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/11/23

	AFTER A COUPLE DAYS OFF, IT FELT A LOT LESS FREAKY TRYING TO REORGANIZE THE NEW SYSTEM.
	
	I GOT THE FIRST BIG BUG SORTED OUT, AND NOW THE SHADOWS TRANSITION PERFECTLY FROM DAY TO NIGHT WITHOUT ANY WEIRDNESS.
	FOR POSTERITY'S SAKE: THE SCALING ISSUES WERE CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS DRAWING THE ENTIRE SHADOW SURFACE TO THE 
	APPLICATION SURFACE AND THEN STRETCHING IT AS AN ELEMENT OF THE APPLICATION SURFACE BEFORE DRAWING THE WHOLE THING.
	NOW THE SHADOW SURFACE IS BEING DRAWN INDIVIDUALLY BY THE GAME OBJECT AFTER DRAWING THE APPLICATION SURFACE.
	
	THE NEXT BUG TO TACKLE IS WHATEVER IS CAUSING THE WEIRDNESS WITH COLLISION AND DEPTH WITH THE NEW SYSTEM FOR DRAWING
	SCENERY. GOOD LUCK!
	
	OKAY, THE BUG REPORT CONTAINS THE CURRENT EXISTING BUGS. GOOD JOB TODAY! HOPEFULLY GITHUB STOPS BEING WEIRD WITH GMS2
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/13/23

	THE ONLY THING LEFT NOW BEFORE NPC PATHS AND DIALOGUE IS TO FIX OBJECT DEPTH AND COLLISION AND DO ANOTHER BIG
	CLEANUP TO OPTIMIZE THE GAME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BEFORE MOVING FORWARD. THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF COMPLETING EACH
	LOCATION, COMPLETING NPC LOGIC, AND THEN MOVING ONTO BATTLES, QUESTS, AND CUTSCENES! HOLY SHIIIIIT IT'S ABOUT TO GET
	SUPER FUN.
	
	REMEMBER: THE CLEANER ALL OF THE CODE IS AT THE END OF THIS PHASE, THE EASIER AND MORE FUN IT WILL BE WHEN IT'S TIME
	TO BUILD OUT THE ACTUAL STORYLINE OF THE GAME.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/20/23

	I ADDED SOME MORE TILEMAPS TODAY AND THEN REALIZED THAT I HAD MISNUMBERED THE TILES ON THE TERRAIN SET. SO I WAS ABLE TO EASILY
	CORRECT ALL OF THOSE ERRORS BY MOVING ALL OF THE GROUND MATRICES TO ANOTHER SCRIPT AND USING THE SEARCH AND REPLACE TOOL TO 
	MOVE EACH NUMBER DOWN A STEP STARTING AT 101 (I HAD SKIPPED 100 ON THE TILESET NUMBERS)
	
	THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO CORRECT WITH THE REMAINING 6 TILEMAPS BEFORE I PUT ALL OF THE DATA IN, BUT ONCE I HAVE THOSE FINISHED
	UP PROPERLY THEN THERES JUST THE BOARDWALK, THE TWO OCEAN ROOMS, AND ALL OF THE INTERIOR LOCATIONS!
	
	IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO START MAKING A PLAN FOR WRAPPING EVERYTHING UP. (OBVIOUSLY THE BATTLE PHASE WILL BE ITS OWN ENTIRE SECTION)
	
	GOOD JOB! IT'S LOOKING GORGEOUS! TEST IT ONCE AND DO A PUSH <3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

3/22/23

	I DID SOME SIMPLE DEBUGGING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN GO TO EACH OVERWORLD LOCATION THAT HAS BEEN BUILT SO FAR. THERE WERE SOME RANDOM TYPOS
	AND LITTLE ISSUES LIKE TRYING TO DRAW AND DESTROY THE UPSTAIRS TILEMAP WHEN IT WASN'T THERE FOR SOME LOCATIONS.
	
	ONLY FOUR OVERWORLD LOCATIONS LEFT TO INPUT!!! WOOHOO!!!
	
	MAKE A UI SURFACE THAT GETS DRAWN AT THE VERY END OF EVERYTHING, AND USE THAT TO DRAW THE ROW AND COLUMN NUMBER OF THE TILE ON WHICH THE
	PLAYER IS CURRENTLY STANDING. THIS WAY, IT WILL BE EASY TO GO THROUGH EACH ROOM AND WRITE DOWN THE COORDINATES OF EACH TILE THAT NEEDS
	TO BE CORRECTED.
	
	GOOD JOB! GOOD LUCK! I LOVE YOU! <3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3	

3/24/23

	SO I GUESS GAMEMAKER DECIDED THAT THEY HATE ME AND THEY CHANGED THE WAY THAT THE DISPLAY BUFFER WORKS.
	
	IT SEEMS THAT I CAN DRAW THE SHADOW SURFACE ON TOP OF THE APPLICATION SURFACE IN THE DRAW END PHASE AND THEN DRAW
	THE APPLICATION SURFACE IN THE POST DRAW PHASE WITHOUT A PROBLEM, BUT THIS CREATES SOME ISSUES WITH SCALING THAT I'LL
	HAVE TO SORT OUT.
	
	FOR WHATEVER REASON, I CAN NO LONGER DRAW THE SHADOW SURFACE ON TOP OF THE APPLICATION SURFACE IN THE POST DRAW PHASE,
	NO MATTER WHAT I TRY. I SUSPECT THAT IT MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH DEPTH, BUT I'M JUST GOING TO POWER FORWARD AND MAKE
	THE OTHER METHOD WORK.
	
	GOOD JOB, SORRY TODAY FUCKING SUCKED <3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3		

3/25/23

	GOT THE GUI SURFACE UP AND RUNNING. SOME SERIOUS SCALING ISSUES LMAO. GOOD LUCK! HAVE A GOOD AY <3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3		

3/26/23

	GREAT JOB TONIGHT! GOT LOTS OF LITTLE VISUAL BUGS FIGURED OUT. HERE'S A LIST OF WHAT GOT FIXED:
	
		-GUI LAYER SCALING ISSUES		SOLUTION:	GUISURFACE NOW MATCHES THE SIZE OF THE RESOLUTION (256*224),
													THEN STRETCHING THAT TO FIT THE APPLICATION_SURFACE WHEN I DRAW
													IT.
													
		-DEBUG CODE FOR TILE EDITING	SOLUTION:	IN THE GAME OBJECT'S DRAW GUI EVENT, THERE IS CODE TO FIND THE
													COLUMN AND ROW NUMBER OF THE TILE ON WHICH THE PLAYER IS CURRENTLY
													STANDING AND DRAW THEM TO THE GUISURFACE AS COORDINATES.
		
		-OBJECT COLLISION				SOLUTION:	THERE WERE TWO PROBLEMS, ONE IS FIXED, ONE REMAINS. THE FIRST WAS
													I SIMPLY DIDN'T SELECT THE CORRECT OPTION FOR COLLISION IN THE 
													SPRITE EDITOR FOR THE LAMPPOST SHEET. THE SECOND (STILL EXISTING) IS
													THAT THE HUMAN COLLISION MASK IS BEING DRAWN IN A FEW PIXELS BELOW
													THE SWIMMING SPRITE NOW, FOR WHATEVER REASON. THAT SHOULD BE AN EASY
													FIX, THERE IS SOME DEBUG CODE IN THE GAME OBJECT SETTING ALL SCENERY
													AND HUMANS TO VISIBLE.
		
		THE LAST THING IS THE ISSUE WITH DEPTH. I THINK THAT THE BEST SOLUTION FROM HERE IS TO:
		
			STEP 1:	MOVE THE BUILDING OF THE OBJECTDRAWLIST AND THE DEPTH SORTING ALGORITHM TO THE STEP EVENT OF OVERWORLDDRAW.
			
			STEP 2:	PLACE A WITHIN THE DEPTH SORTING ALGORITHM, AND PACE BESIDE THE LAMPPOST
			
			STEP 3:	VIEW THE OBJECTDRAWLIST AS A DS_LIST AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAYER AND LAMPPOST ARE CHANGING PLACE PROPERLY.
			
			STEP 4:	IF THEY AREN'T, FIX THE SORTING ALGORITH.
			
			STEP 5: IF THEY ARE, THEN MAKE SURE THAT THE SURFACE IS BEING DRAWN TO PROPERLY, EACH STEP.
			
			STEP 6:	IF IT'S NOT, THEN FIX THE OBJECT_DRAW FUNCTION
			
			STEP 7: IF IT IS, THEN IT MUST BE SOME WEIRD PROBLEM WHERE THE PLAYER IS GETTING DRAWN TO THE APPLICATION_SURFACE
					SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THAT FUNCTION. IF THIS IS THE CASE, THEN DON'T WORRY ABOUT FIXING THIS BUG FOR NOW,
					INSTEAD, JUST FOCUS ON GETTING THE NPCs UP AND RUNNING SO THAT YOU CAN DO MORE TESTING ON THIS.
					
		
		GREAT JOB TODAY! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!!

	WORKED ON DEBUGGING THE DEPTH SORTER. MOVED THE LIST POPULATION AND SORTING TO THE STEP EVENT, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.
	
	WHEN I TRIED TO WATCH THE ORDER OF THE LIST IN REAL TIME, I NOTICED THAT THE LIST WAS EMPTY FOR SOME REASON (BUT EVERYTHING WAS STILL BEING DRAWN)
	
	SEEMS LIKE I HAVE LOTS TO FIGURE OUT HERE STILL! 
	
	GOOD LUCK, GOOD JOB!! <3<3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3	

3/29/23

	FINALLY FIGURED OUT THE PROBLEM WITH DEPTH! I WAS JUST DOING THE MATH WRONG TO FIND THE PROPER Y VALUE TO GET DEPTH XD
	
	SO THAT'S AWESOME! ALL OF THE NEW DRAW STUFF IS STILL REALLY HEAVY, SO IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GO THROUGH AND KEEP OPTIMIZING.
	
	A FEW IDEAS:
	
		-MAKE A "GROUND SURFACE" AND DRAW ALL GROUND  AND WATER TILES TO IT ONCE WHEN THE ROOM IS BUILT, THEN JUST DRAW THE SURFACE
		AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLEAR IT AND DRAW TO IT AGAIN UNTIL YOU CHANGE LOCATIONS.
		
		-THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MATH BEING DONE IN THE OVERWORLDDRAW DRAW EVENTS. GET CREATIVE AND TRY TO MOVE SOME OF THAT TO
		THE STEP PHASE.
		
		-ALSO, IT'S TIME TO NAIL DOWN TEXTURE HANDLING SO THAT IT'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED
		FOR THE FINISHED PRODUCT NOW, SO MAKE A PLAN AND PUT IT TOGETHER!
		
		
	GREAT JOB MAN, IT'S LOOKING BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE YOU AND I'M SO PROUD OF YOU! GOOD LUCK TOMORROW

3/31/23

	I GOT BOULDER BEACH'S INCORECT TILES WRITTEN OUT AND ADDED CODE TO DRAW THE LOCATION NAME SO I CAN FIX ALL THE REST QUICKLY.
	
	EVERYTHING IS RUNNING WELL, AND I GOT THE PROBLEM WITH THE SHADOWS FIXED. TURNS OUT THAT IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL SPEED-
	WISE TO JUST DRAW ALL THE OBJECTS. WE'LL SEE IF I HAVE TO CHANGE THIS AT ALL ONCE I ADD A BUNCH OF OBJECTS INTO A ROOM.
	
	I THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO GO AHEAD AND ADD ALL OF THE OBJECTS TO BOULDER BEACH AND SEE HOW IT RUNS ONCE I DO.
	
	AFTER I GET ALL OF THE TILES AND OBJECTS ADDED TO EVERY AREA, I'M GOING TO ASK YIMING TO TEST IT ON THEIR DIFFERENT
	MACHINES AND SEE HOW IT RUNS.
	
	GOOD JOB TONIGHT! IT LOOKS GOOD :)
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

4/1/23

	IT'S DEFINITELY TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON FOR THE DAY, HERE'S A SUMMARY OF WHAT'S GOING ON:
	
		I CREATED THE SCENERYPLACINGTOOL, A TOOL THAT SERVES THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:
			-W AND S WILL CHANGE THE CURRENT SCENERY ID
			-LEFT CLICKING IN A SPOT WILL PLACE SCENERY OF THE CURRENT ID IN THAT POSITION
			-BACK WILL REPEATEDLY REMOVE SCENERY STARTING WITH THE MOST RECENT (UNDO BUTTON)
			-P WILL SEND A MESSAGE TO THE CONSOLE CONTAINING THE NAMES AND COORDINATES OF EVERYTHING YOU HAVE PLACED
			
		IT IS CURRENTLY BEING CREATED IN THE OVERWORLD CREATE EVENT
		
	THE NEXT ISSUE IS THAT I REALIZED ALL OF THE OBJECTS WERE BEING DRAWN ON TOP OF THE DARKNESS LAYER, SO I IMPLEMENTED A NEW
	SYSTEM WHEREIN THE OVERWORLDDRAW OBJECT CREATES ALL OF THE NECESSARY FRAMES FOR A SPRITE CONTAINING THE DARKNESS LAYER AND THE
	TWINKLING LIGHTS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH ROOM AND THEN DRAWS THOSE AT THE DARKALPHA.
	
	I DON'T LIKE THIS SYSTEM VERY MUCH THOUGH, AND I THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE OPTIMAL TO SIMPLY DRAW THESE THINGS TO A SURFACE IN
	THE DRAW PHASE AND THEN JUST DRAW THE WHOLE SURFACE TO WHAT IS NOW CALLED LIGHTINGSURFACE.
	
	GOOD LUCK! GOOD JOB! I KNOW YOU CAN FIGURE THIS OUT!
	
	OH! ANOTHER COOL THING: I USED THE NEW TOOL TO JUST PLACE A TON OF ROCK CLUSTERS AND IT BARELY EFFECTED THE FPS AT ALL.
	
	WOOHOO!
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

4/4/23

	FINALLY GOT THE LIGHTING SURFACE WORKING PERFECTLY. IT'S NOT RUNNING AT AN INCREDIBLE SPEED NOW, BUT I CAN WORK WITH THIS FOR NOW.
	
	I'M THINKING THAT PART OF THE SLOWNESS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SCENERYPLACINGTOOL.
	
	NEXT, JUST BUILD OUT ALL OF THE LOCAITONS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW ITS RUNNING WITH EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE. 
	
	WHAT'S WORRISOME IS THAT I STILL NEED TO ADD ALL OF THE NPC LOGIC, SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET BACK UP TO AT LEAST 1000 FPS TO HAVE SOME WIGGLE ROOM
	WHEN THAT TIME COMES. 
	
	STEP 1: USE THE CURRENT DEBUG TOOLS TO BUILD OUT THE REST OF THE LOCATIONS.
	
	STEP 2: KEEP OPTIMIZING UNTIL THE GAME IS RUNNING AT AT LEAST 1000 FPS
	
	STEP 3: ASK YIMING TO TEST IT OUT WITH THEIR COMPUTERS TO ENSURE THAT IT'S RUNNING OKAY.
	
	GOOD JOB! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I LOVE YOU <3<3<3<3<3<3
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

4/5/23

	LOGGED ON TO TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT THINGS. FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH THE "P" FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SCENERY PLACING TOOL.
	
	REALIZED THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS TO ADDRESS BEFORE I BUILD OUT ALL OF THE LOCATIONS:
	
		PROBLEM 1:	THE WATER CHECK GET OUT FUNCTION IS ALLOWING ME TO GET OUT ONTO A COLLIDABLE TILE. I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS MIGHT BE. I'LL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT.
		
		PROBLEM 2:	SINCE I'M PLACING THINGS BY CLICKING WHERE THE DRAW ORIGIN (AND THEREFORE THE X AND Y) WOULD BE, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW THINGS THAT ARE HIGH
		UP ON THE SCREEN. SUBTRACT HALF OF THE SPRITE DIMENSIONS FROM THE X AND Y AND PLACE IT IN THAT LOCATION. THIS WILL MAKE THE OBJECT APPEAR WITH ITS CENTER
		DIRECTLY OVER THE MOUSE CURSOR.

4/19/23

	OPTIMIZATION IS GOING WELL. I'M GETTING A SOLID IDEA OF WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET THINGS RUNNING FASTER.
	
	I THINK THERE IS ENOUGH WIGGLE ROOM NOW TO GO AHEAD WITH NPCS.
	
	IN THE FUTURE, I MAY NEED TO CONSIDER CHANGING THE SCENERY FROM AN OBJECT BASED SYSTEM TO A DATA BASED SYSTEM.
	
	MAYBE IT WILL BE FINE! ALL OF THE TEXTURE PAGES ARE BEING MANAGED BETTER, BUT I STILL CAN'T FIND A WAY TO REMOVE THE TEXTURE PAGES
	CREATED FOR EACH DYNAMICALLY CREATED SPRITE.
	
	---------------------------
	
	I JUST EXPORTED THE GAME, INSTALLED IT, AND RAN IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE PERFORMANCE DROPS WERE MOSTLY
	BECAUSE OF THE GAMEMAKER IDE. RUNNING IT AS ITS OWN PROGRAM DOESN'T CREATE THOSE PROBLEMS.
	
	THIS IS GOOD NEWS, I MIGHT NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK LATER, BUT FOR NOW I CAN REST EASY.
	
	I THOUGHT OF A GOOD WAY TO DESIGN THE PATHS SO THAT NONE OF THEM ARE INTERSECTING. I'M GOING TO
	MAKE THE FIRST SET NOW.
	
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3

4/24/23
	
	OKAY! SO FOR SOME REASON PERFORMANCE DROPPED A TON SINCE I LAST TESTED.
	
	I DECIDED IT'S TIME TO REMOVE THE STEP EVENT FROM ALL THE SCENERY.
	
	I FINISHED EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN THE SCENERY SCRIPT, AND I GOT ALL OF THE NEW
	SPRITES ADDED INTO THE SCENERY FOLDER IN A FOLDER CALLED "NEW".

	IT MIGHT BE TIME TO TEST WHEN YOU GET HOME.

4/30/23

	VISUAL BUG LIST:
		-TRANSITION FADE TIMING
		-SHADOW FADE TIMING AT SUNSET/SUNRISE
		-OBJECT DEPTH
		-WALKING OFF-SCREEN TO THE LEFT
	
	THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE BUT THAT'S WHAT COMES TO MIND CURRENTLY.
	
	THE NEXT TIME THAT YOU PLAN TO PLACE SCENERY IN THE OVERWORLD, COMMENT OUT THE CODE THAT 
	KEEPS THE CAMERA FROM PROGRESSING PAST THE EDGE OF THE AREA. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO PLACE THE
	SCENERY WHEREVER YOU NEED.

6/29/23
	
	NEXT STEPS:
		-simplify the lighting system:
			--remove shadows and find out how to re-optimize once this is so
		-fix the bugs listed in the bug report
		-fix all incorrect tiles
			--once this is complete, change out some of the water tiles to utilize
			--the new animations
		-start designing the new architecture for npc behavior

7/22/23

	I simplified the lighting system which resulted in a pretty big performance boost! I also fixed the visual bugs that
	had been occurring (see BUG LIST).
	
	NEXT SPRINT GOAL:
			Able to complete a full day in the game world
			
	SPRINT GOAL PREREQUISITES:
			-complete all interior tilemaps
			-complete new NPC system
			-add "nightly reset" functionality
	
	SPRINT ARTWORK NECESSITIES:
			-construct interior tilesets
			-complete all interior tilemaps
			-finish "nightly reset" artwork
			-design enough clothing items to make all NPCs
			-create human child artwork
	
	SPRINT PROGRAMMING NECESSITIES:
			-implement new NPC system
			-implement "nightly reset" functionality
			-enter NPC data for all characters
			
	
	---I'VE INSTEAD DECIDED TO KEEP THE CURRENT NPC SYSTEM BUT SCRAP SENDPORTS. THIS MEANS I WILL NEED TO MAKE ALL OF THE PATHS SO THAT I CAN MAKE ALL OF THE ROUTINES
		AND COMPLETE THE CURRENT SYSTEM.
		
		MY NEXT STEP IS TO DESIGN ALL OF THE PATHS (BEARING IN MIND THAT EVERYONE MUST NOW TRAVEL ON FOOT). THEN I'LL DESIGN EACH CHARACTER'S ROUTINES ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME,
		FINISHING EACH DIFFERENT ROUTINE AND SCHEDULE FOR THAT CHARACTER BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. THIS SYSTEM MEANS I'LL NEED TO ADD COLLISION LOGIC SPECIFICALLY FOR 
		WHEN NPCS BUMP INTO YOU OR EACH OTHER. MY BASIC PLAN IS TO USE WHAT'S WRITTEN ALREADY AND GIVE EACH NPC A COLLISION LOGIC RESPONSE STYLE. SOME MAY BE ASSERTIVE AND SAY
		"WATCH IT!" BEFORE PUSHING THE OTHER PERSON OUT OF THE WAY, SOME MAY BE POLITE AND SAY "AFTER YOU" BEFORE STEPPING OUT OF THE WAY. EACH OF THEM USE THE SAME LOGIC
		I'VE ALREADY EMPLOYED FOR CHECKING IF YOU CAN GET INTO AND OUT OF THE WATER AT CERTAIN SPOTS.
		
		BEFORE I CAN DESIGN ALL OF THE PATHS, I MUST FINISH DESIGNING EVERY INTERIOR LOCATION. SO THAT'S MY NEXT MISSION FOR A WHILE.
