It's been a while since I checked in here, I deleted all past notes so I can start fresh with the demo from here on out.

I'm going to start by building a list of everything that needs to be finished with the battle scene, then I'll refer to that list
in each of the "last thoughts" notes to follow.

BATTLE SCENE TODO:

	-add spell animations					4 POINTS
	-finish spells and effects				2 POINTS				
	-add abilities							4 POINTS
	-add all new sprites					2 POINTS				
	-create demo scripts*					2 POINTS
	-program spellbook icons				1 POINT
	-program sparSwapProcessor				2 POINTS
	-finish sparActionProcessor				4 POINTS
	-create turn message functionality		1 POINT
	-fix ready display						2 POINTS				2 POINTS DONE [1/16]
	-fix fonts								3 POINTS
	-add music and sound effects			4 POINTS
	-add hp and mp bars						1 POINT					1 POINT DONE [1/16]
	-complete nearby list functionality		1 POINT
	
	*demo scripts cannot be built until full versions are complete (npcs, sprites, spells, abilities)
	
1/16 (added hp and mp bars) &&& (fixed ready display)

		This was my first time back working on the battle scene. It feels good that there's not much left to complete.
	I finally tackled the issue concerning the direction in which a sprite is stretched by the draw_sprite_stretched function. I am
	now drawing the player's and enemy's hp and mp bars to two separate surfaces. The player's surface is then drawn with an x
	scale of -1 using the draw_surface_ext function.
	
		Fixing the ready display was more of a difficult matter. First I had to fix the format_text function. I made it more specific to the
	ready display system, and I added a note about that to the description of the function. Once that was fixed, I decided to take the names 
	out of the picture completely and replace them with a reference to their enemy or ally number respectively. This will make it easier as 
	well when the player is seeing a sprite for the first time and they don't yet know the sprite's name. I also changed the font to the 
	plainFont since it's much easier to fit everything on the banner in an organized fashion.
	
1/17 
	
		Today I just did some tidying up (corrected the casing of all the sprite and spell enums). I also commented out some yet-to-be-written
	processes. I also started working on spell functions, but only completed the solar flare function.
	
		I need to determine exactly how it should look in-game when a swap occurs (this means intentionally and by some spell effect). Ideally,
	the same object will be used for both types of swaps, and any pre-turn swapping will occur all at once. I would love to have an animation
	that covers the sprites when the swap occurs, but I think it would be best to get the process working first and then see what might look good.
