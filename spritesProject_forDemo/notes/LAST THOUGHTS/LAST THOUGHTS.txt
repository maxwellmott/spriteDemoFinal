dIt's been a while since I checked in here, I deleted all past notes so I can start fresh with the demo from here on out.

I'm going to start by building a list of everything that needs to be finished with the battle scene, then I'll refer to that list
in each of the "last thoughts" notes to follow.

1/16 (added hp and mp bars) &&& (fixed ready display)

		This was my first time back working on the battle scene. It feels good that there's not much left to complete.
	I finally tackled the issue concerning the direction in which a sprite is stretched by the draw_sprite_stretched function. I am
	now drawing the player's and enemy's hp and mp bars to two separate surfaces. The player's surface is then drawn with an x
	scale of -1 using the draw_surface_ext function.
	
		Fixing the ready display was more of a difficult matter. First I had to fix the format_text function. I made it more specific to the
	ready display system, and I added a note about that to the description of the function. Once that was fixed, I decided to take the names 
	out of the picture completely and replace them with a reference to their enemy or ally number respectively. This will make it easier as 
	well when the player is seeing a sprite for the first time and they don't yet know the sprite's name. I also changed the font to the 
	plainFont since it's much easier to fit everything on the banner in an organized fashion.
	
1/17 
	
		Today I just did some tidying up (corrected the casing of all the sprite and spell enums). I also commented out some yet-to-be-written
	processes. I also started working on spell functions, but only completed the solar flare function.
	
		I need to determine exactly how it should look in-game when a swap occurs (this means intentionally and by some spell effect). Ideally,
	the same object will be used for both types of swaps, and any pre-turn swapping will occur all at once. I would love to have an animation
	that covers the sprites when the swap occurs, but I think it would be best to get the process working first and then see what might look good.
	
	
2/1 
		Today I tried my best to get the rest processor working completely. As expected, there are a few bugs leftover, but most of the functionality is
	there. Here is a list of bugs to tackle tomorrow:
	
		- animation isn't stopping once it's finished. Do real-time-debugging and watch spar.image_index
		- mp bar isn't being corrected. I put a breakpoint where the mp is being replenished so that I can watch what happens there.
		- not really a bug, but I don't like the pace of the hourglass wiggle. Try some other stuff and see if you can get it right.
		
		Aside from that, I also decided I should add a moment before the process phase where a black screen fades in halway and the current turn number is displayed.
	This would offer a nice beat between the clicking of the ready button and the beginning of the turn, but it would also be a good way to get the turn number in
	there somehow as there isn't room for it in the UI as of right now.
	
	Good luck tomorrow!
	
	
2/2		(finished rest processor)
		Today I finished the rest processor. The bugs were easy fixes. I removed the hourglass because I didn't like the look of it.
	Everything feels smooth and I'm ready to move on to the action processor. There are however a few bugs I'll note here:
		
		- The game currently breaks if you don't do a swap, I'm thinking that this has something to do with the rest check in the swap step event
		- Not really a bug, but you need to figure out how to go about telling the player whether they have enough MP to swap, and then deplete that MP upon swapping.
		
	That's actually all the bugs I can think of currently, I'll test the game in the morning and see if there's anything else that pops up.
	
2/3
		Today I did some debugging. You can now take multiple turns per test and there is no problem with selecting only rests. Dodges and basic attacks are next!
		
2/5	(finished dodge announcer, finished turn message functionality, fixed fonts)

	Today was a good day! Let's keep the momentum going! Tomorrow finish up priority spells and get started on the action processor!
	
	The priority spell list has been started in the spells script. The check for priority spells is happening in the priority case of the switch statement
	in the spar object step event. Good luck!
	
2/9 
	-finish spell functions
	-create a non-demo version of the spell icon art sheet
	-test priority spells
	
	
	finished most spell functions. Here are some things to keep note of:
		-	going to change rearrange and tidal force so that the swap occurs at the end of the effect
		-	need to redo damage calculation functions so that I can finish pyrokinesis, psychic impact, and psychic fissure
		
		
2/16
	Today I added all of the 4 frame sprite artwork. I also brought over the corrected scripts from the calculator.
	The spell animations have also been added into the game, now I just need to program the spellFX object!
	
	Start your next session by correcting the damage calculation functions so that they work in the context of the
	sparActionProcessor. Then test a basic attack, then start working on spells!
	
2/17 
	Today I finished the sparActionProcessor.
	
	The two main things left before spells will be totally ready are:
		-write the spellFX object (step phase should basically copy the dodge FX logic in the actionProcessor step phase
		-write a means for finding the next sprite to cast a spell/make a basic attack (wrote pseudocode in a note on my phone)
		
2/18
	I'm almost to the point where I can successfully make a basic attack.
	
	There is still some debugging left to do before I can move on from basic attacks to spells.
	
	I also started working on the first turntaking algorithm called mercurio_selection_algorithm
	
2/19

		I finished up basic attacks and I'm moving onto spells. I created a script called scr_spellFX where you can build
	the lists of spell animations and spellFX functions.
	
		I also fixed the spellBookList UI, so you can effectively select a spell now. There is still some debugging to do.
		
		Spells are working! And the spellFX script is mostly built. Should be a breeze!
		
2/20
		Okay, we are officially in the "finishing up" phase. Spells are testable and fully working with animations and 
	everything. The last three systems to finish building are the online multiplayer, the spellFX functions, and the 
	local enemy turntaking algorithms.
	
		Aside from that, Yiming and I both just have a lot of art (and I have music and SFX) to finish creating. I THINK NOW
	WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO DO SOME TESTING TO PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF BUGS AS WELL UI FAILINGS AND THINGS THAT I DON'T FEEL
	FLOW WELL.
	
3/5

		Wrote most of the code for the teambuilder. Need to test it still. There is a line of code in the overworld create event
	that is forcing a spar to begin right at the beginning. Find a way to alter this for the sake of testing the teambuilder.
	
	
	I DETERMINED THE BEST NEXT STEP FOR TESTING TEAMBUILDER AND OTHER MENUS:
	
		just build the overworld main menu. It needs to get done, it's a pivotal part of the overworld. This will allow you to fully
		test every menu nested within in an isolated fashion. 
		
		
3/8 
		A GMS update broke my game again. The problem is definitely somewhere in the overworld create event. The wrong data is being pulled
		from the locationGrid somehow. This either means that indeces are not lining up anymore, or something about the decode_grid function
		is not working properly. 
		
		Good luck. Thanks GMS -_-
		
		Got the GMS related bugs sorted out and everything is running fine again. Now to try and fix the issues with the playtest build!
		
		
COMING BACK FROM PLAYTEST BUILD

	Before I go into detail about the first steps coming back from the playtest build/doing serverside work, I'm going to go through each script and
	do some serious organizing.
	
	As you go through each script, follow these steps to quickly organize:
	
		-Check each declaration on the page
		-make sure that the function/variable is still necessary--if not, safely delete the declaration and all references to it
		-make sure that the function/variable has an adequate description and that associated lines have in-line comments
		-make sure that the function/variable is on the right page/in the right spot--this means both the regrouping/reordering of items on the page,
			but also the moving of different items onto different scripts when necessary
			
		GENERAL SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	need to figure out what to do with keypads. If you want to keep it, then rework it and make
					it cleaner. If you don't want to keep it, find a way to safely delete all of it.
					
		OVERWORLD SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	ended up deleting all references to keypads, I was also able to completely get rid of the lighting script which
					is pretty cool. Hopefully the downsizing continues!
					
		PLAYER SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	took this opportunity to change the player's draw function back to the more optimal version wherein
					the player character is drawn layer by layer each step for each of their clothing items, as opposed
					to dynamically creating a sprite to be used.
		


	5/27

	okay, I've taken a break from working on spring cleaning. Soon enough, I'll finish the sparring scripts and then get
	started on objects. I finally got the spell animations and all of that looking pretty good. The lack of a basic attack
	animation is really obvious now.
	
	I need to see what the pose functionality looks like with this new system. If I need to wait until the final release,
	that's fine. If it doesn't look good, that's even finer.
	
	FINAL STEPS FOR SPARS:
	
		-FINISH ALL ABILITY FUNCTIONS
		-FINISH ABILITY TYPE ENUM
		-FINISH ABILITY GRID
		-FINISH ALL ABILITY CHECK FUNCTIONS AND CALLS
		
		-FIX READY DISPLAY TEXT
		
		-CREATE EFFECTS ENUM
		-FINISH EFFECT ALERT OBJECT
		-ADD EFFECT ANIMATIONS
		-FIX SPELL EFFECT SYSTEM SO THAT IT STORES 
			AN ID THAT GETS ADDED TO THE ALERT LIST 
			(DON'T JUST CALL THE FUNCTION IN THE ACTION PROCESSOR)
			
			
			
	5/28
	
		Started doing some p heavy work on the new spar effects system. I'm going to work more on it tonight and give a more
		solid explanation of the overall system. For now, here is this list:
			-finish all spar effect functions
			-replace spar effect function calls in spell functions with spar_effect_push_alert
			-build sparAlert object
			
	5/29
	
		Still working on the replacing all of the spar effect function calls with spar_effect_push_alert.
		
		I left off at ball_lightning!
		
	5/30
	
		Added some more effects. Still finishing up spell effect call replacements. I left off at Hikams
		
	5/31 
	
		LEFT OFF AT REARRANGE!
		
	6/1 
		LEFT OFF AT BARTER TRICK!!
		
		Finished replacing all of the references in the spell functions. The next steps are listed below:
			- finish all spar_effect functions
			- finish all spar_effect alert texts
			- finish sparEffectAlert object
			- finish all ability functions
			- add all ability checks
			- add spellFail check
			- add all effect checks
			
		Started working on spar effect functions
		
	6/2
		CONTINUING SPAR EFFECT FUNCTIONS ---- LEFT OFF AT ENERGY_BLAST_GLOBAL
		
		LIST OF REMAINING TASKS:
			- ability checks
			- ability functions
			- ability check functions
			- effect checks
			- effect check functions
			- effect alert text
			- effect animation timing (display animation after clicking through or loop animation until click through)
			- effect animation placement
			- effect animation sprites
			- damage alteration check
			- spell fail check
			
	6/3
			ADD BERSERK AND INVULNERABLE ENDING FUNCTIONS FOR ALL SCOPES
			FIND ALL instance_destroy(id) ON EFFECTS SCRIPT AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS A ds_list_add(effectedSprites, AS WELL
			
			still working on adding references for effect animations	---- decide what to do about moves like sneak attack and skydive
	
	6/4
			Finished adding all sprite references to spar effect grid.
			I still need to add all of the currently existing effect animations
			Still need to finish the build alert text function and the effectAlert object
			
	6/6
	
			Finished setting subject/object/effectedPlayer/effectedSprites for every spar effect function
			need to finish the build alert text function
			then its time for abilities, ability checks and effect checks!
			
			I ended up getting some more work done. The effect alert system is finished, but there is
			some testing that needs to be done. If you run a match and cast a spell with an effect,
			you'll see the issue and can get to it.
			
	6/7
	
			Spar effects are working! I'll have to keep debugging every spell and every effect over time, but 
			that's what the playtesting phase is for!
			
			I'm going to start another note called spars remaining so that I can log bugs and unfinished code!
			
			Great job getting this up and running, playtesting is right around the corner!
			
	6/29
	
			I got most of the spell info display working. The last issues are within the format_text function. I can't
			seem to find a way to accurately and dynamically check the width of a string. There are a lot of kinks to work
			out with this. I think it may come down to doing kerning in a different way. Some of the positioning looks weird,
			I wonder if it's because I have all of the characters set to the far right of their respective panel as opposed to
			being centered.
			
	6/30
			I changed the format text function again and now it mostly works. I realized also that I don't need to draw the name
			on the info display, so I can either rework the layout to make more room for the description, or think of a way to use
			that space otherwise.
			
	7/1
			I finished the spell display and finished migrating assets over for the build I'm sending to Yiming
			
			It's time to implement the new effect that occurs during spell animations. Refer to the YimingTalkNotes
			for exact details on what should happen. Look into the fastest way to draw things in grayscale in gms2
		
	7/6
			Checking in on this document. 
			
			I'm currently working through the list of everything left in the battle scene that I'm keeping on the 
			SPARS REMAINING note document. Today I finished up all of the changes Yiming and I had talked about. 
			
			This is what the list looks like as I'm typing this:
			
								------BUGS------
				-selecting a spell then selecting swap with a different sprite resets the nextTurnFinalMP
				-lady solanu's grace creates a bug in the effect alert object
				-action reselection not resetting nextTurnFinalMP
				-hover menu is drawn in the wrong position (and looks generally ugly)
				-drain health call is selecting drain magic effect function
				-selecting a swap and a rest keeps the rest from restoring MP. Sometimes swaps don't charge MP.
				
						---INCOMPLETE---
				-turnBegin animation
				-battle start animation
				-win/lose screen
				-ability functions
				-ability grid
				-ability check functions
				-effect check functions
				-effect/ability check calls
				-damage alteration (damage effect spells list + damage effect check)
				-ready display
				-names not drawn
				-titles not drawn
				-turn timer
				
			Good luck <3 Things are looking great!!
			
			
	7/15
	
			TODAY I WAS WORKING THROUGH THE BUG THAT OCCURS AFTER USING LADY SOLANUS GRACE.
			
			THE PROBLEM:	CHECKING FOR SPELL FAILURE ONCE EFFECT ALERT HAS BEEN CREATED IS NOT GOOD
			SOLUTION:		MOVED THE SPELL FAILURE CHECK TO THE SPELL FUNCTION FOR LADY SOLANUS GRACE (ALSO FIXED HEALING LIGHT AND VOLCANIC ERUPTION)
			REMAINING:		STILL CHECKS FOR FAILURE TO EARLY TO SKIP THE ANIMATION. STILL NEED TO CORRECT ALL OTHER SPELLS WITH A FAILURE CONDITION.
			
			completed solving the bug. I moved the spellEffect call earlier in the action processor. This creates a new issue that I will add to the list of spar bugs
			
				NEW ISSUE:	spells that take damage into consideration must calculate damage within the spell function since the call now occurs before the damage calc.
								another option could be calcing damage in the create event and only applying it if necessary (this is optimal but might be difficult)
							
							
	7/22
			TODAY I WAS WORKING THROUGH THE RESETTING OF TOTAL SELECTION COST DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT TURN SELECTION CHANGES.
			
			SO FAR I'VE GOTTEN MOST OF THEM HAMMERED OUT. THERE ARE STILL A FEW REMAINING BUT IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A LIST HERE
			
			
			
			SPRITE |	PREVIOUS ACTION		|	NEW ACTION			//										CORRECTION
			selAlly			swapping				any									subtract swap cost from nextTurnFinalMP. reset swapPartner's selection params.
			selAlly			spell					any									subtract original spellCost from nextTurnFinalMP.
					
					
	7/29
	
			Okay. Everything is a mess now. A lot of weird bugs are occurring. It's time to clean up the spar scripts and then do some in depth debugging. Be ready to rework
			systems if you need to. Currently the most bugs are produced when switching around different selections. There is also a bug wherein selecting fireball results in
			selecting to rest.
			
			Good luck <3
			
	
	8/11
			Okay, things are looking quite good!
			
			Last thing I was working on:
					Finished a few corrections regarding damage. NOTE-- this might have left me with some issues RE the subject and object of some sparEffectAlerts because I had thought
				it was no longer necessary to pass those arguments within the spar_effect_push_alert function call in some of the spell functions. I think I fixed them all, but I might
				have missed one or two.
				
					After I finished all of that, I was working on the effectCheck functions in scr_effectChecks. These functions are all meant to be called at different times during the
				spar (for example, spar_check_miasma would be called at the beginning of each turn). When you log on next, just get back to work on this script. Once this is finished, you
				can start finishing up all of the ability functions. Then the ability check functions, then place the ability check functions in their proper place!
				
	8/14
			I got a lot of work done with the effect check system. Most of the remaining checks are obvious, you just need to go through the functions on the effectCheck script
		and complete all of them. Once you've done that, just global search for each function to make sure it's being called in all of the right places.
		
			None of this has been tested so for, but once the rest of the functions are finished and in place, start testing out each effect!
			
			
	8/18
		Here is a short list of things I know I need to do:
			-add undertow, typhoon, and magnetic pulse to priority spells and change undertow and typhoon to force_swap (make sure MAGpulse has higher power than purifying flame)
			-make all ability functions and check functions!
			-make a spar_effect for ability calls so that they can always show the same alert animation and formatted text "__'s ability, _______ was triggered!"
			
	8/19
		Running into a weird bug. Recreate by attempting to swap the same sprite twice in one match. Watch spar.allyList and spar.teamList. Also check ready display before second swap
		
	8/30
		Finish the ability script and add place all ability check calls
		
	9/1	
		Abilities What's Left:
			- finish all ability functions (first couple are done--use them as a reference)
			- add ability name animation (animation can be its own object. it should be set in the activate_ability function)
			- test
			
		-add weak elemental spells that provide solid buffs
		
	9/13 removed some notes to clear space for the above list. Books are done. Ability checks are done.
	
	9/16
		Finished a couple of new spar effects that will make things easier for some of the funky abilities. namely, kronarc, drumline, scrootineyes, and jackhammer
		
		You will likely need to make another global variable and a new spar effect for abilities that change the stat used to calculate basic attack damage (exonolith and cragma)
	
		kronarc's arbitrate turn shouldn't happen twice if drumline is also present
		
		range improve is not working
		
	9/19
		I have finished spars to the point that I need to now move onto the overworld.
		
		Since I'm just focusing on completing something that I can submit for pax, it's probably time for me
		to move on to the overworld and make the demo feel more like an actual game. I'll create a list on a separate note that
		broadly contains everything that must be completed before submitting to pax by nov 4th.
		
		I'll make another note that contains more specifically everything that needs fixing in the overworld.
		
		I also corrected the spars remaining note so that it only contains things that must still be completed/perfected at THIS point.
		
	9/20
	
		I GOT MY PRIORITIES IN ORDER REGARDING THE NEXT MONTH AND A HALF.
			THIS WEEK, I WANT TO GET A PLAYTEST BUILD PUT TOGETHER AND SENT TO MY FRIENDS.
			
			THEN, I WILL WORK ON DRM AND A TIMEBOMB SCRIPT SO THAT I CAN HAVE THEM SEND COPIES
			TO PEOPLE THAT I DON'T KNOW AND DISTRIBUTE IT TO WHOEVER JOINS THE DISCORD.
			
			I GOT THE AUDIO MANAGER WORKING ENOUGH FOR THE PLAYTESTING BUILD, SO NOW I JUST NEED TO COMPLETE
			THE FOLLOWING:
				-DEBUG ALL ABILITIES AND SPELLS
				-NEW SPELLBOOK BUILDER
				-CHARACTER CREATOR
				-SAVE/LOAD
				-SPAR INFORMATION BOOK W ART
				-ADD ALL MUSIC AND SFX
				-OVERWORLD INTERACTABLE TO ACCESS ONLINE LOBBY
				-CREATE A SMALL ROOM WITH THE PLAYER AND THAT INTERACTABLE AND 
						COMMENT OUT ALL OF THE TIME INCREMENTING FUNCTIONS
						
	9/23
	
			I DID A LOT OF DEBUGGING
			
			I NEED TO FINISH UP THE PLAYTESTING BUILD IN TIME FOR SATURDAY
			
			ONLY THINGS LEFT ARE OVERWORLD RELATED. I SHOULD DO SOME MORE PLAYTESTING AS WELL TO FIND AND FIX AS MANY BUGS AS POSSIBLE.
			
			ALSO YOU NEED TO ADD THE TURN TIMER!
			
	9/25
	
			I GOT A BUNCH OF SPAR BUGS FIGURED OUT. JUST KEEP TESTING, IF YOU COME ACROSS A SPELL OR ABILITY THAT YOU HAVEN'T TESTED, TEST IT!
			
			STILL SOME ISSUES WITH MINDSETS--NO OTHER BUGS FOUND SO FAR. YOU STILL NEED TO TEST INVULNERABILITY AS WELL AS MANY TRICK AND PHYSICAL SPELLS
			
	10/9
			FIXED A BUNCH OF OVERWORLD DRAW STUFF. I'M GOING TO MAKE AN OPENING AND CLOSING ANIMATION FOR BOOKS AND DRAW THEM THE SAME WAY THE MAIN MENU IS BEING DRAWN
			
			I'M ALSO GOING TO START ON THE CHARACTER CREATOR, WHICH MEANS I'LL NEED TO ADD MIRRORS (THIS IS HOW YOU ALTER YOUR APPEARANCE)
			
			I added all the sprites and the font for the keyboard menu and got it integrated to the OW layout
			
	10/10
			FINISHED THE KEYBOARD MENU. THERE IS STILL DEBUG CODE TO RESET YOUR NAME BY CLICKING SHIFT IN THE OVERWORLD.
			
			ONCE THE CHARACTER CREATOR IS FINISHED, MOVE THIS CODE TO THE END OF THE CHARACTOR CREATOR (SO LONG AS THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW FILE)
			
	10/14
			Emote system is almost complete.
			
			There are some issues with the emote menu
			
			I also need to add some more NPCs and NPC dialogue to test the functionality of NPCs adding emotes to the grid through encoded dialogue
			
	10/15
	
			Starting to realize I don't really have a deadline aside from pax next year (scary)
			
			Menus are coming along quickly. I'm going to get the character creator finished, and then finish
			every other part of the action menu.
			
			SO YOU DON'T FORGET:
			
			Action Menu Options:
				-change appearance
				-play wavephone
				-cast spell
				-access inventory
			
			Basics of inventory/items:
				-all obtainable items will have an "inventory" sprite. There will be a grid specifically
					for obtainable inventory items (some will also be scenery, some will also be food, some will
					also be literature, etc)
				-most items will prompt you to add them to your inventory (picking berries off of a bush, ordering
					food at a restaurant "is that for here or to go?", some books will be obtainable as well, depending
					on where you find them.
				-so books will have an "obtainable" boolean variable along with other items in a similar boat
				-"placing" items will not be an option until you have 
				
				
			Basics of spells:
				-When a spell is cast, a black circle appears center-screen. Inside the black circle, the spell animation
					from the battle scene will play. (for animations that take up the whole screen, I will use elements
					of Yiming's work to recreate smaller versions)
				-scenery objects and npcs will have a list of "applicableSpells". If the list is greater than 0 items long,
					they will run a "listen_for_spell" function that takes a spell ID and a function (both stored on the
					applicableSpells function as an encoded list). 
						If that spell is cast while they're on the screen:
							-an overworld alert will explain that a piece of scenery has responded to the spell
							-an npc will display an emote that indicates they have a new piece of dialogue awaiting you
							
			Basics of Wavephone
				-When you take out your wavephone, an indicator appears on the screen in front of a rolling grid.
				-The indicator is drawn two surfaces. One surface has the current indicator drawn in the center. Both
					surfaces draw the indicator relative to the mouse's y position on the screen. The second surface
					draws everything in one color at half alpha, it never clears itself so you can see the trail of where
					the indicator has been (the trail is only drawn while a note is being played)
				-Different sections of the screen will be broken up into two octaves of notes. (if using keyboard)
				-If using gamepad, the pitch will be relative to the position of the right analog stick
				-Different buttons will play different tones. Ideally: One synth tone, one noise tone, one triangle tone
				-Change pitch on one sound file using built-in pitch changing functions
				
			Basics of change appearance
				-Open up a version of the character creator that excludes name entry and skintone selection
				-only allow colors of dyes that have been unlocked in-game
				
	10/16
	
			I added all of the new clothing artwork. I also added the artwork for the appearance editor and the character creator. I also created
			and added the art for the wavephone display.
			
			Wavephone display tracker works like this:
			
				-tracker is displayed on the staff relative to mouse y on the screen (or gamepad right analog stick y)
				-multiple surfaces of the same size are being drawn between the tracker and the staff
				-when playing a tone, the tracker draws itself (in a faint yellow color) onto the surfaces while they continously
					slide to the left (similar to ready button)
				-surfaces do not clear themselves until they are completely off screen.
				
	10/19
			I've been steadily working through the action menu. I got the menu itself complete. I just need to add artwork for each button, and finish
			each function that is stored on the action menu option grid.
			
			Once the action menu and all subsequent menus are complete, it's time to finish all the submenus attached to the main menu.
			
			After that, it's time to fix dialogue textboxes and the response system.
			
	10/20
	
			get the sine of the times (lmao) every frame and use these two functions to destroy the old buffer and then create and play a new one.
			
			You'll need to do the math to use the sine of the times (lmao) to create a .wav file. Try and find the video of that guy doing it in c#
			
			here are the built-in functions you'll need:
			
				audio_create_buffer_sound();
	
				audio_free_buffer_sound();
				
	10/20
	
			Well it's making noise and it doesn't sound too bad! For day one I think that's a good start!
			
			Going to try and implement an audio bus with a low and high pass filter and some reverb!
			
	10/28
			Okay, that ended up being a bit of a timesink, but it's workable for now!
			
			Next up, appearance menus:
				-	Create some accessory art
				-	Create all clothing text grids
				-	Create dyes list
				-	build appearance menu!
				
	10/29
			Completely debug NPC dialogue (you'll need to debug the build dialogue function)
			
			build the character creator
			
	11/1
	
			Okay! I got the dialogue system working in a new and better way. Here is a quick writeup:
			
					I changed the grid encoding/decoding functions so that they can feasibly house infinite nested grids with no issues. I left solid
				comments throughout the new functions, so things should be pretty clear. They've also been thoroughly tested, so there shouldn't be any
				concern from here on out.
				
					This is so that I can use the new structure of:
						
						Player Interacts With NPC -->	NPC response function sets global.dialogueGrid (one of the grids stored on the NPC's response map)
						--> first row of response grid is displayed	--> IF (there is more than one row on the grid) {
																			--> create the response menu
																			--> get the corresponding grid stored on the player response map
																			--> display response options
																			--> GET (player response option)
																				--> display the next row of the NPC response grid
						--> IF (the displayed NPC response has *GIFT* indicated in the text
							--> player receives inventory item or unlockable from the NPC
							--> overworld alert is displayed for either inventory item or unlockable
						--> IF (the displayed NPC response has *SPAR* indicated in the text
							--> begin a spar upon closing the talkBubble
						
					This is what you need to do to get the above system working:
						-- FIX SPAR INDICATION TO TALK BUBBLE BUILD FUNCTION
						-- ADD GIFT INDICAITON TO TALK BUBBLE BUILD FUNCTION
						-- CREATE RESPONSE MENU
						-- FIX TALK BUBBLE CREATE EVENT (display global.currentDialogueRow--this needs to be added)
						
	11/2		DEBUG THE EMOTE QUEUE FUNCITONALITY IN THE STEP EVENT OF THE TALK BUBBLE
				CREATE THE RESPONSE MENU OBJECT
				
	11/3		Okay, I'm shifting over to the turntaking algorithms since that's the priority now. Start by finishing all of the pseudocode in the document titled: ENEMY AI WRITEUP
	
	11/15
	
		CONTINUE WORKING ON THE SPELL EVAL FUNCTIONS
		
	11/23
	
		PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ON ENEMY AI CORE FUNCTIONS
		
	11/26
		
		ENEMY AI:
			-add a functionality that tracks the projected gain/loss of MP for the turn and also checks this projected gain/loss when checking for MP costs
			-complete the mercurio day one function
			-complete all core functions
			-test
			-rework each chunk of code for each sprite on mercurio's team so that they can be used as portable functions to select the turns of any sprites of that archetype
			
	12/12
	
			- almost done testing each spell, then I will test each ability and return to enemy ai while I also finish the overworld and complete playtesting
			
	12/28
	
			- hail sphera isn't depleting hp for some reason
			
	12/29 
	
			- finished testing all spells!
			- add all the updated sprite artwork to gms2
			- fill out data for all "NEW_SPRITES" and "NEW_ABILITIES"
			
	1/1
	
			I just finished inputting most of the data for the new sprites that had yet to be added.
			
			I still need to build three abilities. 
			
			FLAMILIAR	-- ENDLESS WICK (need to add ability check for "spell cost check"
			VEWRR		-- TEARS AND JEERS
			DECIDRUID	-- PERENNIAL GROWTH (need to add an "immobile" variable that keeps the user from selecting a new action)
			
	1/4
			-flamiliar ability complete
			-vewrr ability complete
			-decidruid ability complete
			
	1/10
			-check inrange after forced swap!
			
	1/16
			-add a pause during the announcement of the upcoming action (e.g. "Demolitops is preparing to make an attack!")
			-stop displaying the announcement after the pause
			
			-left off at metal muncher (put chromaliodon back on the team)
			
	1/19
	
			-ability testing finished!
			-time to work on the rest of the spar bugs, tomorrow you can announce playtesting!
			
	1/20
			-FINISH HPMP NUMBERS DISPLAY
			-CHANGE FLASHING BAR FUNCTIONALITY -- NOT AN ANIMATED SPRITE, JUST SWITCH BETWEEN DRAWING THE FLASHING BAR AND THE REGULAR MP BAR BASED ON GLOBAL.GAMETIME
			-FINISH FLASHING BAR FUNCTIONALITY
			-DRAW nextTurnFinalMP INSTEAD OF CURRENT MP WHENEVER DRAWING FLASHING BAR
			-ALLOW OUT OF RANGE SPELL/ATTACK SELECTION
			-PERFORM A RANGE CHECK DURING THE CREATE PHASE OF THE SPAR ACTION PROCESSOR
			-CHANGING THE LAST TWO BULLETS MAY REQUIRE YOU TO REWORK SCROOTINEYES' AND JACKHAMMER'S ABILITIES
			
	1/26
			-FINISHED HPMP NUMBERS DISPLAY
			
			I'm trying to fix the whole system for tracking the potential cost etc.
			
			Here's the plan:
				-global.mpCostDiff should only be called within the functions to set potential costs									CHECK
				-potentialCost functions can remain where they are																		CHECK
				-the spar step event should use the selectedActions and selectedTargets of each ally to calculate the totalCosts		CHECK
				-calculation should only occur during the selectionPhase of the spar													
				
			I finished making all of the above changes and there was a huge dropoff in gamespeed which was surprising.
			
			I'll have to do some in-depth debugging and figure out what the problem is. I'm worried it's just too complex of an operation to run so frequently.
			
			FIRST THING TO TRY:		add a boolean variable for whether the cost has been checked since a sprite made their selection. You can switch the boolean to
									false at the end of the set_action, set_target, set_self_target functions. Switch the boolean to true after performing the operation
									in the spar step.
				
	1/27
	
			OKAY, IT'S FINISHED!
			
			CHANGES FOR RANGE CHECK:
				- add a range check to the actionProcessor
				- move the range correction ability check to the actionProcessor range check
				- display out of range indicator when hovering over an out of range sprite
				- add a spar effect for "out of range target selected" and push the alert whenever the user selects an out of range target
			
			RESTING SHOULD ALWAYS REGAIN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MP
			
	1/31
			I just need to add a range check to the action processor. I also still need to add the ability check here (it should be fine to just do another range check ability check)
			
	2/1	
	
			Okay. I completely finished correcting range checks and mp tracking. There may still be a few bugs with the latter, but it waits to be seen.
			
			Next up:
				-rebuild the list of remaining spar bugs
				-make a list of all remaining spell and effect animations
				-add the new name font
				-add titles
				-make documentation for playtesters
				-schedule the first playtesting session!
