It's been a while since I checked in here, I deleted all past notes so I can start fresh with the demo from here on out.

I'm going to start by building a list of everything that needs to be finished with the battle scene, then I'll refer to that list
in each of the "last thoughts" notes to follow.

1/16 (added hp and mp bars) &&& (fixed ready display)

		This was my first time back working on the battle scene. It feels good that there's not much left to complete.
	I finally tackled the issue concerning the direction in which a sprite is stretched by the draw_sprite_stretched function. I am
	now drawing the player's and enemy's hp and mp bars to two separate surfaces. The player's surface is then drawn with an x
	scale of -1 using the draw_surface_ext function.
	
		Fixing the ready display was more of a difficult matter. First I had to fix the format_text function. I made it more specific to the
	ready display system, and I added a note about that to the description of the function. Once that was fixed, I decided to take the names 
	out of the picture completely and replace them with a reference to their enemy or ally number respectively. This will make it easier as 
	well when the player is seeing a sprite for the first time and they don't yet know the sprite's name. I also changed the font to the 
	plainFont since it's much easier to fit everything on the banner in an organized fashion.
	
1/17 
	
		Today I just did some tidying up (corrected the casing of all the sprite and spell enums). I also commented out some yet-to-be-written
	processes. I also started working on spell functions, but only completed the solar flare function.
	
		I need to determine exactly how it should look in-game when a swap occurs (this means intentionally and by some spell effect). Ideally,
	the same object will be used for both types of swaps, and any pre-turn swapping will occur all at once. I would love to have an animation
	that covers the sprites when the swap occurs, but I think it would be best to get the process working first and then see what might look good.
	
	
2/1 
		Today I tried my best to get the rest processor working completely. As expected, there are a few bugs leftover, but most of the functionality is
	there. Here is a list of bugs to tackle tomorrow:
	
		- animation isn't stopping once it's finished. Do real-time-debugging and watch spar.image_index
		- mp bar isn't being corrected. I put a breakpoint where the mp is being replenished so that I can watch what happens there.
		- not really a bug, but I don't like the pace of the hourglass wiggle. Try some other stuff and see if you can get it right.
		
		Aside from that, I also decided I should add a moment before the process phase where a black screen fades in halway and the current turn number is displayed.
	This would offer a nice beat between the clicking of the ready button and the beginning of the turn, but it would also be a good way to get the turn number in
	there somehow as there isn't room for it in the UI as of right now.
	
	Good luck tomorrow!
	
	
2/2		(finished rest processor)
		Today I finished the rest processor. The bugs were easy fixes. I removed the hourglass because I didn't like the look of it.
	Everything feels smooth and I'm ready to move on to the action processor. There are however a few bugs I'll note here:
		
		- The game currently breaks if you don't do a swap, I'm thinking that this has something to do with the rest check in the swap step event
		- Not really a bug, but you need to figure out how to go about telling the player whether they have enough MP to swap, and then deplete that MP upon swapping.
		
	That's actually all the bugs I can think of currently, I'll test the game in the morning and see if there's anything else that pops up.
	
2/3
		Today I did some debugging. You can now take multiple turns per test and there is no problem with selecting only rests. Dodges and basic attacks are next!
		
2/5	(finished dodge announcer, finished turn message functionality, fixed fonts)

	Today was a good day! Let's keep the momentum going! Tomorrow finish up priority spells and get started on the action processor!
	
	The priority spell list has been started in the spells script. The check for priority spells is happening in the priority case of the switch statement
	in the spar object step event. Good luck!
	
2/9 
	-finish spell functions
	-create a non-demo version of the spell icon art sheet
	-test priority spells
	
	
	finished most spell functions. Here are some things to keep note of:
		-	going to change rearrange and tidal force so that the swap occurs at the end of the effect
		-	need to redo damage calculation functions so that I can finish pyrokinesis, psychic impact, and psychic fissure
		
		
2/16
	Today I added all of the 4 frame sprite artwork. I also brought over the corrected scripts from the calculator.
	The spell animations have also been added into the game, now I just need to program the spellFX object!
	
	Start your next session by correcting the damage calculation functions so that they work in the context of the
	sparActionProcessor. Then test a basic attack, then start working on spells!
	
2/17 
	Today I finished the sparActionProcessor.
	
	The two main things left before spells will be totally ready are:
		-write the spellFX object (step phase should basically copy the dodge FX logic in the actionProcessor step phase
		-write a means for finding the next sprite to cast a spell/make a basic attack (wrote pseudocode in a note on my phone)
		
2/18
	I'm almost to the point where I can successfully make a basic attack.
	
	There is still some debugging left to do before I can move on from basic attacks to spells.
	
	I also started working on the first turntaking algorithm called mercurio_selection_algorithm
	
2/19

		I finished up basic attacks and I'm moving onto spells. I created a script called scr_spellFX where you can build
	the lists of spell animations and spellFX functions.
	
		I also fixed the spellBook UI, so you can effectively select a spell now. There is still some debugging to do.
		
		Spells are working! And the spellFX script is mostly built. Should be a breeze!
		
2/20
		Okay, we are officially in the "finishing up" phase. Spells are testable and fully working with animations and 
	everything. The last three systems to finish building are the online multiplayer, the spellFX functions, and the 
	local enemy turntaking algorithms.
	
		Aside from that, Yiming and I both just have a lot of art (and I have music and SFX) to finish creating. I THINK NOW
	WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO DO SOME TESTING TO PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF BUGS AS WELL UI FAILINGS AND THINGS THAT I DON'T FEEL
	FLOW WELL.
	
3/5

		Wrote most of the code for the teambuilder. Need to test it still. There is a line of code in the overworld create event
	that is forcing a spar to begin right at the beginning. Find a way to alter this for the sake of testing the teambuilder.
	
	
	I DETERMINED THE BEST NEXT STEP FOR TESTING TEAMBUILDER AND OTHER MENUS:
	
		just build the overworld main menu. It needs to get done, it's a pivotal part of the overworld. This will allow you to fully
		test every menu nested within in an isolated fashion. 
		
		
3/8 
		A GMS update broke my game again. The problem is definitely somewhere in the overworld create event. The wrong data is being pulled
		from the locationGrid somehow. This either means that indeces are not lining up anymore, or something about the decode_grid function
		is not working properly. 
		
		Good luck. Thanks GMS -_-
		
		Got the GMS related bugs sorted out and everything is running fine again. Now to try and fix the issues with the playtest build!
		
		
COMING BACK FROM PLAYTEST BUILD

	Before I go into detail about the first steps coming back from the playtest build/doing serverside work, I'm going to go through each script and
	do some serious organizing.
	
	As you go through each script, follow these steps to quickly organize:
	
		-Check each declaration on the page
		-make sure that the function/variable is still necessary--if not, safely delete the declaration and all references to it
		-make sure that the function/variable has an adequate description and that associated lines have in-line comments
		-make sure that the function/variable is on the right page/in the right spot--this means both the regrouping/reordering of items on the page,
			but also the moving of different items onto different scripts when necessary
			
		GENERAL SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	need to figure out what to do with keypads. If you want to keep it, then rework it and make
					it cleaner. If you don't want to keep it, find a way to safely delete all of it.
					
		OVERWORLD SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	ended up deleting all references to keypads, I was also able to completely get rid of the lighting script which
					is pretty cool. Hopefully the downsizing continues!
					
		PLAYER SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED!
			notes:	took this opportunity to change the player's draw function back to the more optimal version wherein
					the player character is drawn layer by layer each step for each of their clothing items, as opposed
					to dynamically creating a sprite to be used.
		


	5/27

	okay, I've taken a break from working on spring cleaning. Soon enough, I'll finish the sparring scripts and then get
	started on objects. I finally got the spell animations and all of that looking pretty good. The lack of a basic attack
	animation is really obvious now.
	
	I need to see what the pose functionality looks like with this new system. If I need to wait until the final release,
	that's fine. If it doesn't look good, that's even finer.
	
	FINAL STEPS FOR SPARS:
	
		-FINISH ALL ABILITY FUNCTIONS
		-FINISH ABILITY TYPE ENUM
		-FINISH ABILITY GRID
		-FINISH ALL ABILITY CHECK FUNCTIONS AND CALLS
		
		-FIX READY DISPLAY TEXT
		
		-CREATE EFFECTS ENUM
		-FINISH EFFECT ALERT OBJECT
		-ADD EFFECT ANIMATIONS
		-FIX SPELL EFFECT SYSTEM SO THAT IT STORES 
			AN ID THAT GETS ADDED TO THE ALERT LIST 
			(DON'T JUST CALL THE FUNCTION IN THE ACTION PROCESSOR)
			
			
			
	5/28
	
		Started doing some p heavy work on the new spar effects system. I'm going to work more on it tonight and give a more
		solid explanation of the overall system. For now, here is this list:
			-finish all spar effect functions
			-replace spar effect function calls in spell functions with spar_effect_push_alert
			-build sparAlert object
			
	5/29
	
		Still working on the replacing all of the spar effect function calls with spar_effect_push_alert.
		
		I left off at ball_lightning!
		
	5/30
	
		Added some more effects. Still finishing up spell effect call replacements. I left off at Hikams
		
	5/31 
	
		LEFT OFF AT REARRANGE!
		
	6/1 
		LEFT OFF AT BARTER TRICK!!
		
		Finished replacing all of the references in the spell functions. The next steps are listed below:
			- finish all spar_effect functions
			- finish all spar_effect alert texts
			- finish sparEffectAlert object
			- finish all ability functions
			- add all ability checks
			- add spellFail check
			- add all effect checks
			
		Started working on spar effect functions
		
	6/2
		CONTINUING SPAR EFFECT FUNCTIONS ---- LEFT OFF AT ENERGY_BLAST_GLOBAL
