It's been a while since I checked in here, I deleted all past notes so I can start fresh with the demo from here on out.

I'm going to start by building a list of everything that needs to be finished with the battle scene, then I'll refer to that list
in each of the "last thoughts" notes to follow.

BATTLE SCENE TODO:

	-add spell animations
	-add spell backgrounds
	-program a pause for spell/attack/swap animations to play
	-finish spells and effects
	-add abilities
	-add all new sprites
	-replace spell and sprite scripts with demo versions
	-program spellbook icons
	-create turn message functionality
	-fix ready display												DONE [1/16]
	-fix fonts
	-add music and sound effects
	-add hp and mp bars												DONE [1/16]
	
	
1/16 (added hp and mp bars) &&& (fixed ready display)

		This was my first time back working on the battle scene. It feels good that there's not much left to complete.
	I finally tackled the issue concerning the direction in which a sprite is stretched by the draw_sprite_stretched function. I am
	now drawing the player's and enemy's hp and mp bars to two separate surfaces. The player's surface is then drawn with an x
	scale of -1 using the draw_surface_ext function.
	
		Fixing the ready display was more of a difficult matter. First I had to fix the format_text function. I made it more specific to the
	ready display system, and I added a note about that to the description of the function. Once that was fixed, I decided to take the names 
	out of the picture completely and replace them with a reference to their enemy or ally number respectively. This will make it easier as 
	well when the player is seeing a sprite for the first time and they don't yet know the sprite's name. I also changed the font to the 
	plainFont since it's much easier to fit everything on the banner in an organized fashion.
