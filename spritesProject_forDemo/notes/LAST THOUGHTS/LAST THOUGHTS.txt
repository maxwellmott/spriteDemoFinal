It's been a while since I checked in here, I deleted all past notes so I can start fresh with the demo from here on out.

I'm going to start by building a list of everything that needs to be finished with the battle scene, then I'll refer to that list
in each of the "last thoughts" notes to follow.

1/16 (added hp and mp bars) &&& (fixed ready display)

		This was my first time back working on the battle scene. It feels good that there's not much left to complete.
	I finally tackled the issue concerning the direction in which a sprite is stretched by the draw_sprite_stretched function. I am
	now drawing the player's and enemy's hp and mp bars to two separate surfaces. The player's surface is then drawn with an x
	scale of -1 using the draw_surface_ext function.
	
		Fixing the ready display was more of a difficult matter. First I had to fix the format_text function. I made it more specific to the
	ready display system, and I added a note about that to the description of the function. Once that was fixed, I decided to take the names 
	out of the picture completely and replace them with a reference to their enemy or ally number respectively. This will make it easier as 
	well when the player is seeing a sprite for the first time and they don't yet know the sprite's name. I also changed the font to the 
	plainFont since it's much easier to fit everything on the banner in an organized fashion.
	
1/17 
	
		Today I just did some tidying up (corrected the casing of all the sprite and spell enums). I also commented out some yet-to-be-written
	processes. I also started working on spell functions, but only completed the solar flare function.
	
		I need to determine exactly how it should look in-game when a swap occurs (this means intentionally and by some spell effect). Ideally,
	the same object will be used for both types of swaps, and any pre-turn swapping will occur all at once. I would love to have an animation
	that covers the sprites when the swap occurs, but I think it would be best to get the process working first and then see what might look good.
	
	
2/1 
		Today I tried my best to get the rest processor working completely. As expected, there are a few bugs leftover, but most of the functionality is
	there. Here is a list of bugs to tackle tomorrow:
	
		- animation isn't stopping once it's finished. Do real-time-debugging and watch spar.image_index
		- mp bar isn't being corrected. I put a breakpoint where the mp is being replenished so that I can watch what happens there.
		- not really a bug, but I don't like the pace of the hourglass wiggle. Try some other stuff and see if you can get it right.
		
		Aside from that, I also decided I should add a moment before the process phase where a black screen fades in halway and the current turn number is displayed.
	This would offer a nice beat between the clicking of the ready button and the beginning of the turn, but it would also be a good way to get the turn number in
	there somehow as there isn't room for it in the UI as of right now.
	
	Good luck tomorrow!
	
	
2/2		(finished rest processor)
		Today I finished the rest processor. The bugs were easy fixes. I removed the hourglass because I didn't like the look of it.
	Everything feels smooth and I'm ready to move on to the action processor. There are however a few bugs I'll note here:
		
		- The game currently breaks if you don't do a swap, I'm thinking that this has something to do with the rest check in the swap step event
		- Not really a bug, but you need to figure out how to go about telling the player whether they have enough MP to swap, and then deplete that MP upon swapping.
		
	That's actually all the bugs I can think of currently, I'll test the game in the morning and see if there's anything else that pops up.
	
2/3
		Today I did some debugging. You can now take multiple turns per test and there is no problem with selecting only rests. Dodges and basic attacks are next!
		
2/5	(finished dodge announcer, finished turn message functionality, fixed fonts)

	Today was a good day! Let's keep the momentum going! Tomorrow finish up priority spells and get started on the action processor!
	
	The priority spell list has been started in the spells script. The check for priority spells is happening in the priority case of the switch statement
	in the spar object step event. Good luck!
	
2/8 
	-finish spell functions
	-create a non-demo version of the spell icon art sheet
	-test priority spells
