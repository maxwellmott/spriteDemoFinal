		-selecting a spell then selecting swap with a different sprite resets the totalSelectionCost
		-lady solanu's grace creates a bug in the effect alert object
		-action reselection not resetting totalSelectionCost
		-hover menu is drawn in the wrong position (and looks generally ugly)
		-drain health call is selecting drain magic effect function
		-selecting a swap and a rest keeps the rest from restoring MP. Sometimes swaps don't charge MP.

			7/31 Note	
				
		Still some bugs with the flashing MP bar. I need to figure out a way to clearly communicate
		how much total MP will be lost at the end of the turn. The whole thing stopbs being drawn if
		a sprite selects to rest.
		
		Lady Solanu's grace still doesn't work also. You have to damage your teammates a bit to test it.
		
		KEEP WORKING THROUGH SOLANUS
