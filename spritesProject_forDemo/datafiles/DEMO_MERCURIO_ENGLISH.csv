placeholder,preMatch1,*0NERVOUS* I'm so nervous. I'm not sure if this is sweat or if I unlocked some powerful water spell
placeholder,preMatch2,The headmaster gave me the pep talk of a lifetime. Today I'm just gonna focus on doing better than yesterday.
placeholder,preMatch3,Apparently you and I are facing each other today! I can't wait to see what you throw at me!
placeholder,preMatch4,I'm feeling so fired up after our match yesterday! This wasn't so bad after all.
placeholder,postMatch1,*0SAD* I barely lasted 5 minutes out there… I knew I'd choke if there were people here. Even Mr Domino came. God I'm so embarrassed…
placeholder,postMatch2,"*0JOYFUL* Well, I still lost, but I had a lot of fun. I feel like I'm starting to get how swapping works."
placeholder,postMatch3,*0JOYFUL* I had a great time sparring with you. I learn so much from you guys. It's crazy how clearly I can see your thoughts when we're sparring.
placeholder,postMatch4,*0JOYFUL* I wish you could've seen my spar against Marco! I almost had him. He even admitted he was nervous the whole second half of our match!
placeholder,opponentPreMatch,"Alright _, it's finally our turn. Don't go easy on me!"
placeholder,opponentWon,I can't believe it! You'd better not have been going easy on me!
placeholder,opponentLost,Ahhhh man! I thought I had you!
placeholder,cutsceneOneDialogueOne,Wait--w-why would we do that? I don't want random people from the island to come watch me spar.
placeholder,byeMatch1,I wonder if we'll have some time to practice after the festival. I want to use the training fields to work on my spellcasting.
placeholder,dayOnePostFest,"I admit, today ended up being a lot of fun. I get so nervous before sparring, but once I get in the groove it feels great! Especially when I'm with my friends."
placeholder,dayTwoPostFest,I'm sorta sad this is all over. It's been a while since anyone has come to visit Miriabram. This really made me feel more connected to the rest of the island.

placeholder,preBye1,"Haha, to think that earlier I was trying to get the Headmaster to cancel the festival. Now I'm mad that I don't have another match till tomorrow! "
placeholder,preBye2,
placeholder,dayOnePreFest,Gosh I'm so nervous. I tried convincing the Headmaster to cancel this thing—or at least push it back to tomorrow—I just know I'm gonna do terribly…

placeholder,sparPrompt1,*1SPAR* I can't sleep quite yet. I keep thinking of my match earlier and I feel like my mind is on fire with new ideas. So what do you say? Wanna have a spar with me and help me prepare for tomorrow?
