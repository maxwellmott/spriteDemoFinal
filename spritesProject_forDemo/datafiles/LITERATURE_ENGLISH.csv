placeholder,"%Inhuman Entities%+++ by + Gregoria Von Verstolen | Since humankind has found itself imprisoned on the island of Stackrock, there have been apparitions manifesting themselves within the physical plane. In the First Age, Jean-Jaque Senut coined the umbrella term ""Sprites"" in a document wherein he expounds on their many fascinating characteristics. For generations, this document was held as the leading literature on the matter. Since it was first published, many other intellectuals have attempted to document this phenomenon by means of encyclopedia. Unfortunately, due to their ever-changing nature, this style of documentation is not necessarily ideal. + As I write this book, we are living in the Second Age. By now, time has shown us that the many forms these ""Sprites"" can take are near limitless. So--rather than attempt to record and analyze the traits of any single sprite--I will instead evaluate and describe the patterns in their appearances, arrivals, behaviors, and their abilities. So, let us begin our dive into the world of sprites and their general nature as perceived by humankind over time. |%The Many Faces of the Ethereal%++ I'll go into further detail about this later on, but all you must know for now is that sprites can materialize in our plane for many different reasons and by many different causes. The nature of their initial arrival has a permanent effect on their physical characteristics, though it isn't the only determining factor of the sprite's attributes throughout their life. When a sprite is summoned by a human for some human purpose, they tend to look more humanoid. Sprites such as this have also been recorded as tending to have flesh of a greenish hue. Sprites that are formed through acts of nature or magic tend to be more monstrous and strange looking. + Size also seems to be related to the nature of the initial summoning. Tiny sprites are frequently born, it's been theorized by many of my colleagues and predecessors that there could be microscopic sprites coming into existence and then departing with our every breath. If this were the case, though, these quantum-sized apparitions would be totally invisible and unable to really affect the physical plane. This would be due to the fact that sprites need to have a strong presence to be able to materialize in or manipulate the corporeal realm. This is why the sprites that do appear to humans at any point tend to be those that stick around for a while. Although this is generally true, there have been special circumstances in which certain humans and sprites find themselves frequently being visited by sprites who are only briefly passing through. + There is also a clear relationship between the sprite's abilities and their appearance. For example, the sprite displayed in Figure 1 excels in aquatic environments and can cast many spells imbued with the element of water. I imagine that, based on its appearance, one would probably have an easy time guessing so. *0*  Not all sprites will have a purpose that is plain for all to see, and not all sprites will be totally aware of their purpose. Most sprites that are summoned by nature itself tend to have a solid idea of what they're here to do. Just like many other general rules regarding sprites, this is not always the case. After expounding on the general patterns of sprite appearances, a prevalent theme begins to emerge: regardless of how well one could argue that something is true for all sprites, this is simply never the case. |"
