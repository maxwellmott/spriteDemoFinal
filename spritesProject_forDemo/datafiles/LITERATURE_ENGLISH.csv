placeholder,"%Inhuman Entities%+++by+Gregoria Von Verstolen|Since humankind has found itself imprisoned on the island of Enastra, there have been apparitions manifesting themselves within the physical plane. In the First Age, Jean-Jaque Senut coined the umbrella term ""Sprites"" in a document wherein he expounds on their many fascinating characteristics.+As I write this book, we are living in the Second Age. By now, time has shown us that the many forms these ""Sprites"" can take are near limitless. So instead of attempting to record and analyze the traits of any single sprite, I will instead evaluate and describe the patterns in their appearances, arrivals, behaviors, and their abilities.|%The Many Faces of the Ethereal%++I'll go into further detail about this later on, but all you must know for now is that sprites can materialize in our plane for many different reasons and by many different causes. This has a permanent effect on their physical characteristics. When a sprite is summoned by a human for some human purpose, they tend to look more humanoid. Sprites such as this also tend to have flesh of a greenish hue. Sprites that are formed through acts of nature or magic tend to be more monstrous and strange looking.+Size also seems to be related to the nature of the initial summoning. Tiny sprites are frequently born, it's been theorized by many of my colleagues and predecessors that there could be microscopic sprites coming into existence and then departing with our every breath. There is also a clear relationship between the sprite's abilities and their appearance. For example, the sprite displayed in Figure 1 excels in aquatic environments and can cast many spells imbued with the element of water, and you would probably have an easy time guessing so.*0*|"
